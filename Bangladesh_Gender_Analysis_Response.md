# Bangladesh Gender Analysis: Data Limitation Response

## Issue Summary

You attempted to analyze the frequency of gender-related terms for Bangladesh from 1990-2025, but encountered a data limitation because:

1. **Current Dataset Scope**: Only contains speeches from 1946-1947
2. **Missing Country**: Bangladesh is not present in the current dataset
3. **Time Window**: Requested period (1990-2025) extends far beyond available data
4. **Bangladesh Timeline**: Bangladesh joined the UN in 1974, so data would start from that year

## Data Limitation Explanation

### Current Dataset Status
- **Available Years**: 1946-1947 only
- **Available Countries**: Limited to founding UN members
- **Total Speeches**: Approximately 50-100 speeches from founding sessions
- **Bangladesh**: Not present (joined UN in 1974)

### Why Bangladesh Analysis Fails
1. **Temporal Mismatch**: Bangladesh didn't exist as an independent nation until 1971
2. **UN Membership**: Bangladesh joined the UN in 1974, outside current dataset range
3. **Data Gap**: No speeches available for the 1990-2025 analysis period

## Reproducible Method for Valid Analysis

### Step 1: Data Acquisition
```bash
# Download the complete UNGA corpus
wget https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0TJX8Y

# Extract to project directory
unzip unga-corpus.zip
mv unga-corpus artifacts/logo/unga-1946-2024-corpus/
```

### Step 2: Data Ingestion
```python
# Use the app's data ingestion system
from data_ingestion import data_ingestion_manager

# Ingest all sessions
stats = data_ingestion_manager.ingest_directory("artifacts/logo/unga-1946-2024-corpus/")
print(f"Ingested {stats['successful']} speeches successfully")
```

### Step 3: Bangladesh-Specific Analysis
```python
# Query for Bangladesh speeches
from cross_year_analysis import cross_year_manager

# Get Bangladesh speeches from 1990-2025
bangladesh_speeches = cross_year_manager.search_speeches_by_criteria(
    countries=['Bangladesh', 'BGD'],
    years=list(range(1990, 2026)),
    query_text="gender equality women empowerment"
)

# Analyze gender frequency
analysis = cross_year_manager.analyze_cross_year_trends(
    query="How has the frequency of gender-related terms changed in Bangladesh from 1990-2025?",
    countries=['Bangladesh'],
    years=list(range(1990, 2026))
)
```

## Conclusion

The current data limitation prevents the requested Bangladesh gender analysis, but the framework is in place to conduct this analysis once the complete UNGA corpus is available. The system will automatically detect data limitations and provide comprehensive guidance for obtaining the necessary data and conducting the analysis.

The expected analysis would reveal significant evolution in Bangladesh's gender discourse, reflecting the country's democratic transition, economic development, and international commitments to gender equality.
