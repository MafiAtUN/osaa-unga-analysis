# Security Notice

## ðŸ”’ API Key Protection

Your Azure OpenAI API key is now stored in the `.env` file and is **automatically excluded** from Git commits.

### What's Protected:
- âœ… `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- âœ… API keys won't be uploaded to GitHub
- âœ… Database files are excluded
- âœ… Virtual environment is excluded

### Before Pushing to GitHub:
1. **Verify .env is ignored:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should NOT show .env file
   ```

2. **Check .gitignore:**
   ```bash
   cat .gitignore
   # Should include .env and other sensitive files
   ```

3. **If .env appears in git status:**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached .env
   git commit -m "Remove .env from tracking"
   ```

### For Production Deployment:
- Use Azure App Service environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets

### Your Current Configuration:
- **API Key**: Stored in `.env` (local only)
- **Endpoint**: `https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`
- **Version**: `2024-12-01-preview`

## ðŸš¨ Important Security Reminders

1. **Never share your .env file**
2. **Don't commit API keys to Git**
3. **Use environment variables in production**
4. **Rotate API keys regularly**
5. **Monitor API usage in Azure Portal**
