 2 Thank you, Madame President.  
For eight decades … the United Nations has endured.  
A beacon of hope for the world.  
A defender of dignity and freedom.  
A shield against aggression —whether for the mighty, or 
the small.  
 
And a foundation for cooperation… that has lifted 
millions out of poverty… and given humanity a chance to 
move forward, together.  
Yet, the vision penned 80 years ago remains unfulfilled.  
Peoples and nations continue to suffer under oppressive 
regimes.  
We face new, threats —from criminal networks to 
planetary and technological challenges —that overwhelm 
natural systems, economies, and even basic human rights.  
These are global challenges.  
They don’t stop at borders.  
 
And no matter how powerful a nation may be —none of 
us can meet them alone.  
 3 Now, more than ever, we need to work together.  
Now, more than ever, we need the United Nations.  
And if the UN has fallen short of its promise… it’s not 
because the idea is flawed , it’s because too often, its 
members —including the most powerful among us —have 
failed to act  
And we see the cost of that failure today.  
The world is facing more conflicts than at any time in 
recent decades.  
This year alone, six nuclear powers have been drawn into 
conflict  –in Asia, in Europe, and in the Middle East.   
Military spending rose by 9 percent to $2.7 trillion last year  
even as  global insecurity deepened.  
That is more than half the GDP of all the Countries of 
Latin America and the Caribbean.  
Wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan , dragging on year after 
year.  
Hundreds of thousands  dead.  
Millions displaced, orphaned, left with nothing .  
The images should compel us to act .  
 4 And ye t too often  the UN is actively blocked from doing 
its job . 
In Gaza, one of the largest man -made humanitarian crises 
grows worse day by day .  
The UN’s relief agency —lifeline  to millions —is being 
pushed to the brink .  
And t he two -state solution ...the vision of peace  this body  
has long supported... , is slipping away . 
In Sudan, a UN embargo has not stopped the killing .  
In Haiti , gangs  have overrun  the country.  
Political turmoil deepens.  
And a mission meant to restore order —Kenyan led, 
backed by the UN --remains  underfunded, and under -
resourced.  
These are only a  few of many crises . 
And in each  of them , weapons flow.    
Drugs flow . 
Violence crosses borders.  
And governments are left weaker, peace fleeting.   
These are not isolated tragedies.  
They are a warning.  
 5 They reveal  a pattern of international indifference, 
disregard for international law, impunity, a tolerance of 
inhumanity and deepening cynicism.   
So the question before us is simple: do we allow this cycle 
to continue , or will we summon the will—together —to 
break it?  
Over the last two weeks, my country, has chosen to act 
with restraint and caution, in the face of repeated 
aggressive and provocative actions by our neighbour 
Guatemala at our southern boundary.  
Actions which seek to challenge Belize’s sovereignty and 
territorial integrity.  
Actions that do not accord with the obligations of states 
not to exacerbate or extend a dispute before the 
International Court of Justice .  
Latin America and the Caribbean are committed to 
maintaining our region as a zone of peace – an area free 
of nuclear weapons, an area where conflicts are prevented 
through dialogue.  
It is for this reason that we are concerned about the 
serious implications of utilising military tactics against 
civilian vessels in the Caribbean Sea . 
 
Madame President,  
 6 For forty -four years of independence, Belize has been a 
peaceful and welcoming nation .  
We have been a refuge —for those fleeing war and terror 
from countries near and far.  
Per capita, we have absorbed more immigrants than any 
other country in our region.   
These new Belizeans have enriched our society and enjoy 
equal protection under the law.  
Every Belizean also benefits from free primary education 
and accessible  free or low -cost healthcare.  
 
Through Plan Belize 2.0 , we are  building on that 
foundation by expanding tuition coverage, improving 
healthcare, raising the minimum wage, creating more 
decent jobs and widening  access to housing.  
We have an ambitious energy transition plan  that places  
Belize on track to surpass  net zero  through  innovative 
financing that turns  our forests and reefs into investments 
for conserva tion.  
But a mbition come s at a cost.    
My government has chosen  fiscal discipline  even as we 
pursue this bold agenda.  
 7 Belize is the fifth most vulnerable Small Island Developing 
State to climate risk , ranked second in the world for 
impacts from extreme weather.  
Rising seas are already displac ing some coastal  
communities, extreme heat strains our energy systems, and 
unpredictable rainfall threatens our farmers.  
Fishers must now travel farther and risk more for declining 
catches in warming seas.  
Food security is under threat.  
So too are the health  of our people , their livelihoods, and 
the survival of our ecosystems.  
This is our lived realit y—it is not science fiction , it is not 
abstract theor y, it is a danger to our overall security.  
 
Madame President,  
 
Our world is so intricately interconnected ; disruption  
anywhere reverberates everywhere .    
Geopolitical and geoeconomic competition  are 
consequential globally.  
So too is the  persistence of disease, hunger, poverty  and 
the inequalities amongst peoples and nations . 
 8 Small states like my own then, must vigilantly guard against 
restive neighbours seeking to sustain territorial claims 
through military provocation or aggression.  
This is not the world that the founders of the UN 
envisioned .   
Instead,  it is a world embattled.  
A world divided.  
And yet, it is not a world without solutions.  
Over 80 years, nations have agreed on laws and policies to 
defend human rights, pursue sustainable development, 
promote disarmament, and protect the vulnerable  and our 
environment .  
We have built strong institutions that remain vital, even if 
reform is overdue.  
But we cannot face today’s challenges by relying on legacy 
alone.   
In the pursuit of larger freedom and dignity for all, let us 
act with urgency to rescue the development agenda , leaving  
no one behind.   
For our part, Belize will spare no effort .  
 9 Through Plan Belize 2.0  and the implementation of our 
NDCs 3.0 , we are working to lift our people out of poverty 
and to secure a healthy environment.    
But w e cannot do it alone.  
We need international support that has been promised . 
The Compromiso de Sevilla  offers us a chance to  re-energize 
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . 
A chance to renew commitments especially to Small Island 
Developing States.    
This is why Belize calls for the urgent attention to  the 
Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS .  
We must mainstream the multi -dimensional vulnerability 
index.  
We must expand access to grants and concessional finance 
not more debt, and we must strengthen SIDS participation 
in global financial decision making.  
At COP30 in  Belem, Belize urges the G20 —responsible 
for 80 percent of emissions —to commit to more ambitious 
emissions reductions targets.  
Developed nations and development banks must lead the 
mobilisation of 1.3 trillion dollars in climate finance and 
prioritize  SIDS, whose adaptation and loss -and-damage 
needs are most urgent.    
 10 It is high time ---past time --for the global financial system 
to reward environmental stewardship , to recognize the  true 
value of our natural assets  for long -term resilience .   
Consider this:  30 percent of the world’s ocean lie within 
the jurisdiction of s mall island developing states , much  
under some form of protection.     
These marine environments help regulate the global 
climate, yet we receive little for our efforts.    
Only  one percent of climate finance flows  to SIDS, half of 
which are  loans.   
Meanwhile  the fossil fuel industry , with trillions of dollars 
in subsidies, annually  is not just  perverse, it is dangerous.  
Let us reverse this by investing more, much more in nature 
based and nature positive solutions.  
With only five years remaining to achieve the SDGs, 
urgency is paramount.  
Madam President  
Realizing the ambition of leaving no one behind requires 
the involvement of everyone .  
Yet the UN still excludes one critical actor: the people of 
Taiwan.  
 11  
Taiwan is a thriving democracy with global leadership in 
high-tech innovation —semiconductors, AI, 
biotechnology, renewable energy —all vital to global supply 
chain security and sustainable development.  
Taiwan already contributes to the SDGs, assisting partners 
with advanced technology.  
We therefore urge the United Nations to find appropriate 
ways to recognize Taiwan as an indispensable partner in 
our shared pursuit of sustainable development.  
 
Madame President,  
 
The people of Haiti deserve our urgent and united support  
to completely expunge the criminal gangs that have 
attempted to overrun that country  and to ensure they are 
brought to justice.  
A workable path forward for Haiti exists but it requires 
sustained security assistance, resources, and a coherent 
international response.  
We must act now.   
 
Madame President,  
Each nation must be free to define its own path.  
 12 The International Court of Justice has affirmed that self-
determination is a peremptory norm.   
We must end the denial of this right to the people of 
Western Sahara  whose plight the world continues to 
ignore .  
The economic, commercial and financial blockade 
imposed by the United States of America against Cuba  
must end and Cuba must immediately be removed from 
the list of countries that allegedly sponsor terrorism.   
It is illegal, inhumane, and contrary to the UN Charter.  
And the genocide in Palestine must stop  now.  
What hope can a child in Gaza have for tomorrow, when 
their home is destroyed, their family murdered,  their future 
erased?   
What hope can there be if their right to self -determination 
is extinguished?  
The UN once confronted apartheid in South Africa —with 
declarations, sanctions, conventions, and suspension of t he 
regime  from this Assembly.  
We must draw that lesson again.  
No regime that desecrates the Charter and destroys a 
people has a place in this Hall.  
 13 And that is why the rule of law must prevail.   
No man, no country stands above the law of nations.  
Belize took its seat in this Assembly in 1981, less than half 
a century ago.   
Our Membership was a milestone for our sovereignty .  
Global recognition of Belizean sovereignty also meant full 
recognition of our territory.  
We stand firm in the conviction that the boundaries of that  
territory were agreed in 1859, m ore than a century and a 
half ago .  Our anthem proclaims it: “From the proud Rio 
Hondo to the old Sarstoon, through coral isle, over blue lagoon.”  
Though our territory is contested, we remain firm, not 
belligerent.  
Tested, but not subdued.  
Threatened, but not deterred.  
Because the rule of law is on our side.  
Together with Guatemala, we submitted our dispute to the 
ICJ in 2019. We await the Court’s decision.  
We trust that justice will prevail .   
 14 In the meantime,  we reiterate our demand that Guatemala 
desists from any provocative behaviour which ha s the 
potential to affect our otherwise friendly bilateral relations.   
We reiterate our invitation to Guatemala to work with 
Belize in designing confidence building measures for the 
Sarstoon river and maritime spaces.  
 
Madame President,  
 
Belize believes in our common humanity and in the 
existence of the common good.  
Equity and justice are our guiding principles.  
As we commemorate the 80th anniversary of this great 
institution, let us not only reflect on the past but recommit 
ourselves to its future.  
Let us affirm —together —that multilateralism is not an 
option but an obligation.  
That the rule of law is not an aspiration but a necessity.  
That the dignity of every human being is not negotiable but 
inviolate . 
 
Belize pledges to do its part: to stand for law over force, 
for cooperation over division, for justice over impunity.  
And we call on every Member State to do the same.  
 15 Only then can we make real the promise of the Charter —
peace, prosperity, and larger freedom —for all peoples, in 
every nation, for generations yet to come.  
 
Thank you.
