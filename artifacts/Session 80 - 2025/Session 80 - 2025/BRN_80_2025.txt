 Bismillahirrahmanirrahim  
 
Madam President,  
Mr. Secretary -General, Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Assalamualaikum  Warahmatullahi  Wabarakatuh,  
Peace be upon you all.  
 
At the outset,  I bring  the warm  greetings  of His Majesty  Sultan  Haji 
Hassanal  Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di -
Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, to this esteemed Assembly.  
 
Allow  me also to extend  heartfelt  congratulations  to Her Excellency  
Annalena  Baerbock  on assuming the Presidency of this historic 80th 
Session of the General Assembly. We wish her a successful tenure.  
 
I also express  appreciation  to His Excellency  Philémon  Yang  for his 
leadership  of the 79th Session, and I commend Secretary -General 
António Guterres for his tireless service in guiding our Organisation 
through turbulence and uncertainty.  
 
Madam President,  
 
The 80th anniversary  of the United  Nations  is more  than a 
commemoration.  It is a solemn opportunity for reflection and renewal.

 Before 1945, our world was fractured by war and colonial rule. From 
that devastation, the UN  was born.  Its Charter  is not just a legal  text, 
but a moral  covenant , a collective  vow to  save  succeeding  
generations  from the scourge  of war and to stand against the 
dehumanisation  of people.  
 
For small states like Brunei  Darussalam , which regained full 
independence in 1984, membership  in the UN affirmed  not only 
sovereignty,  but dignity,  equality,  and belonging  within  the family of 
nations.   
 
This is why our commitment to this Organisation remains unwavering. 
It is the only forum where every nation, large or small, developed or 
developing, can stand and speak as equals.  
 
Over the course of eight decades, the UN has delivered remarkable 
progress. It helped prevent the escalation of conflicts , supervised 
elections, and restored stability to many parts of the world . It has 
eradicated smallpox, contained Ebola  outbreaks , and delivered hope 
during the COVID -19 pandemic.  It feeds  the hungry,  educates  the 
children,  and protects  cultural  heritage.  
 
The UN has led global climate action, forged development, first 
through the Millennium Development Goals, and later the Sustainable 
Development Goals .

 It has also helped to  shape international law , from the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights to  the 1982 United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea, which remains the “Constitution of the 
Oceans.”  
 
These achievements have inspired Brunei ’s own journey . We remain 
committed to nurturing peace and harmony, advancing sustainable 
development, and pursuing environmental conservation and climate 
action.  
 
Regionally, we work through ASEAN to promote peace, prosperity, 
and integration. We also engage beyond the region through our 
participation in APEC, FEALAC, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the 
CPTPP to strengthen cooperation  and enhance development . 
Hosting the ASEAN Centre for Climate Change reflects our 
determination to turn our climate ambitions  into action.  
 
Guided by the principles of the United Nations, even a small country 
like Brunei Darussalam has found its place in the world , contributing 
to peace through humanitarian aid and peacekeeping. In the past, we 
supported relief and reconstruction efforts in Aceh following  the 2004 
Indian Ocean tsunami, and participated in  peace monitoring in 
Mindanao.

 Today, we continue this role through the  observer teams , led by 
Malaysia, which  were  deployed to monitor the ceasefire between 
Cambodia and Thailand. Additionally, we maintain our long -standing 
participation in the UN Interim Forces in Lebanon,  where Bruneian 
women and men serve with dedication.  
 
Madam President,  
 
What the UN has  achieved so far is not a minor  feat. They  are the very 
essence  of our shared  humanity . 
 
Yet, we would be dishonest to speak only of successes.  
 
The Security  Council,  the guardian  of peace,  has too often  been  
paralysed , restricted  by veto, divided by interests, and mute in the 
face of grave injustice .  
 
Nowhere is th is failure more glaring, more tragic, than in Palestine . 
 
The inaction  undermines  not only the Council's  credibility,  but the very 
foundation  of the United Nations. It reminds us why reform is not an 
option , but an urgent necessity.  
 
Brunei support s efforts to make  the Security Council more 
representative, transparent, and accountable in its action , and to limit  
the use of veto  towards its eventual elimination.

 Madam President,  
 
Eighty  years  ago, after the horrors  of the Second  World  War,  humanity  
made  a vow: Never Again. Never again to genocide.  Never again to 
killing with impunity. Never again to silence in the face of atrocity.  
 
Yet today,  in Gaza,  we see actions  that betray  that vow: indiscriminate  
bombings,  forced displacements, collective punishments, and  
weaponisation  of food and medicine.   
 
Entire neighbourhoods in Gaza have been reduced to rubble under 
the guise of security. Children  are born under  blockade.  Water  is 
undrinkable.  Electricity  is a luxury.  Freedom  is a dream.  
 
We are told this is about defence . But when  bombs fall on schools, on 
hospitals, on houses of worship . When  humanitarian  aid workers,  
journalists  and medics are killed with impunity. What are they really 
defending?  
 
The suffering  inflicted  upon the  Palestinian  people  bears  chilling  
resemblance  to the last century’s  darkest  chapters . Chapters marked 
by the Holocaust, by ethnic cleansing, and by the mass uprooting of 
entire populations during the Second World War.  
 
Today, to ignore such patterns of suffering is not neutrality . It is 
complicity , it is humanity abandoning its conscience.

 It is profoundly  troubling  that the very phrase  “Never  Again,”  born from 
the ashes  of the Holocaust, finds itself contradicted by the actions of 
the occupying regime.  
 
Its relentless pursuit of expansionism through annexation, illegal 
settlements, and the systematic erasure  of Palestine  echoes the 
ideologies of the past, such as the “Greater Germanic Reich,” which 
once sought domination at the expense of justice and humanity.  Both 
of these ideologies  contradict  international  law and the collective  vow 
of ‘Never Again ’. 
 
“Never  Again”  does  not belong  to one people  alone.   
 
It is a universal  promise for all humankind. And we should stop 
breaking that promise.  
 
Recogni sing the State of Palestine , and supporting its full membership 
in the UN, is not a reward . It is an inherent right of the Palestinian 
people. It is  a matter  of principle,  justice, and humanity.  
 
Brunei stands in unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people, 
and in this regard, we fully support the New York Declaration 
endorsed at the High -Level Conference on the Question of Palestine, 
co-chaired by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the French Republic. 
We believe it offers a path for a just and lasting peace.

 We say all this not out of hatred,  but out of hope  for a future  where  
both Palestinians  and Israelis live in peace , not with domination, but 
with dignity, not with revenge, but with reconciliation.  
 
Madam President,  
 
The theme  of this year’s  General  Assembly,  “Better  Together,”  is more 
than a slogan.  It is a responsibility.  
 
It means renewing our faith in multilateralism.  
 
It means strengthening the United Nations’ three pillars: peace and 
security, human rights, and development.  
 
And it means embracing inclusivity, transparency, and respect.  
 
For small states, multilateralism is not an option . It is our lifeline. As 
we confront climate change, pandemics, inequality, and conflict, no 
nation  can stand alone. Only together  can we secure  a peaceful,  just, 
and sustainable  world  for generations  yet to come.  
 
The United Nations at 80 is not only about history . It is about a 
promise. A promise to be better together.  
 
A promise to ensure no voice is silenced, and no nation , regardless of 
size, is left behind.

 And so, I end by quoting the words of His Majesty the Sultan and Yang 
Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, spoken in this very Hall last year 
during the Summit of the Future and I quote  ‘Let us reaffirm our 
commitment to upholding the UN Charter and international law without 
prejudice or discrimination, to unite our nations strongly.’  End quote.  
 
Let us reaffirm multilateralism .  
 
Because the world is watching.  Because the future is listening.  And 
because together, only together we will endure  and keep the promise 
of ‘Never Again ’. 
 
Thank you.
