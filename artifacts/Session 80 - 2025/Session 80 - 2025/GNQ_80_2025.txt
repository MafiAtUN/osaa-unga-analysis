SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY TEODORO NGUEMA OBIANG MANGUE, VICE - PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA, IN CHARGE OF DEFENSE AND STATE SECURITY, IN THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 80TH ORDINARY SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS.……………………………………………………………. New York, September 25, 2025 -1- Her Excellency Annalena Baerbock, President of the 80th General Assembly of the United Nations, Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, and Heads of Delegations, His Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen; ***//*** -2- I am honored to speak on behalf of His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, to express the firm position of my Country in this 80th General Assembly, at a time when the world demands a more just, equitable and effective international system. ***//*** -3- Madam President; 80 years ago, the Founding States established this Organization with the aspiration of building a multilateral system based on Cooperation, respect for international law and the dignity of every person. That commitment was established in the Charter of the United Nations, which continues to be an essential reference for the collective action of States. ***//*** -4- Today, under the theme "Better together: 80 years and more for Peace, Development and Human Rights", we celebrate important achievements. The UN has been, throughout these decades, a universal forum for dialogue and a space for international cooperation. It has helped avoid conflicts, accompanied decolonization processes, promoted sustainable development, and served as a moral conscience in defense of human rights. ***//*** -5- However, this anniversary should be an occasion for critical reflection. It would be a mistake to limit ourselves to commemoration and not recognize the profound deficiencies facing our multilateral system. Excellencies; The people of the world trust the UN to act against the great challenges of our time: armed conflicts and violence, climate change, growing inequalities, migration crises, the cyber threat and the lack of technology transfer. -6- But too often, the response has been insufficient, paralyzed by particular interests and trapped in an institutional platform that no longer reflects the reality of the contemporary world. Talking about "leaving no one behind" is meaningless if millions remain marginalized in systems of dependency and exclusion. ***//*** -7- The Security Council, the body in charge of International Peace and Security, is perhaps the clearest example of this imbalance. Eight decades after its creation, its composition remains anchored in the geopolitics of 1945 and not in that of the 21st century. Consequently, its legitimacy and representativeness are rightly questioned. ***//*** -8- The reform of the Security Council is an urgent need. Without it, it will continue to be perceived as an exclusive club of historical privileges, incapable of responding legitimately to current challenges. Africa demands what is rightfully its right: full and permanent representation in the most important security body on the planet. ***//*** -9- We want international governance that serves everyone, not a few. We demand a Security Council that represents the world of today, not yesterday. Let us take real steps towards more democratic, equitable and effective collective action, or we risk the UN becoming increasingly marginalized and weakened in international affairs. ***//*** -10- Our commitment to this Organization remains intact. We believe in the UN. We believe in the force of international law. We believe in international cooperation as the only way to face challenges that no nation, no matter how powerful, can solve alone. Well, our commitment is not blind; but is demanding results, reforms and adaptation to the times. ***//*** -11- On this anniversary, we must remember that Peace, Development and Human Rights are inseparable pillars. Peace is not sustainable without development, and development is not real if it is not based on the dignity and rights of each person. ***//*** -12- Therefore, we reaffirm our commitment to the 2030 Agenda, even recognizing delays and difficulties. The 2030 Agenda is a collective commitment that reflects our will to build a world without poverty, without hunger and with dignity for all. However, we have less than a decade left to achieve it and progress is too slow. ***//*** -13- Excellencies; Climate change is the biggest threat of our time. The most vulnerable nations pay a disproportionate price as large emitters postpone commitments. ****//**** -14- Climate justice is not a gesture: it is a moral and legal obligation. Equatorial Guinea also defends the principle of State sovereignty. Each people has the right to design its own development model without interference or arbitrary sanctions that undermine its independence. We must believe in a world of Peace, where no country is considered an enemy for being a friend of others. ***//*** -15- Allow me to share a recent example of Equatorial Guinea's contribution to International Peace: the historic agreement with the Republic of Gabon on the sovereignty of the islands of Mbañé, Cocoteros and Conga. For decades, His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo led this dispute with patience and dialogue until it was resolved peacefully under the protection of the International Court of Justice. ***//*** -16- This case not only creates a historical precedent on the African continent, but also demonstrates that conflicts can be resolved in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and the political will of States. Excellencies; -17- The promotion of human dignity is a shared responsibility. Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its commitment to the protection of the rights of children and people with disabilities. The rights to food security, housing, drinking water and the sovereign exploitation of natural resources are an inseparable part of human rights. Without material dignity, freedom is an empty ideal. ***//*** -18- Faithful to the principles of an inclusive international community, we insist that the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against the Republic of Cuba be lifted. Maintaining these types of measures not only seriously affects the development of a sovereign nation, but also contradicts the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. ***//*** -19- Excellencies; Finally, I would also like to address business men and women, to invite them to discover Equatorial Guinea as a safe and attractive destination for investment. Our Country offers a framework of political stability, competitive tax advantages and a clear vision of the future through our Horizon 2035 Development Agenda. We encourage you to accompany us on this path, which will not only generate shared benefits, but will also consolidate inclusive and sustainable development in our Nation. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
