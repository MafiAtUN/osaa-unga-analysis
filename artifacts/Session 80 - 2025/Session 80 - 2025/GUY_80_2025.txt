Address by 
His Excellency Dr. Mohamed Irfaan Ali  
President of the Co -operative Republic of Guyana  
to the 80th Session of the General Assembly of the 
United Nations  
September 23rd 2025  
 
Madam President,  
Excellencies,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Friends  
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Madam President, on 
your  election as President of the 80th Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly.  
 
I also record my profound appreciation to His Excellency Philemon 
Yang of Cameroon, whose distinguished stewardship and steady 
hand guided the 79th Session.  

 
 2  Today, as we mark the 80th anniversary  of the entry into force of 
the United Nations Charter, we find ourselves at a crossroads.   
 
This Organization, our Organization, has delivered .   
 
From creating international law, promoting development  and 
human rights , to resolving disputes , providing humanitarian aid 
and advancing self -determination and independence . The fact 
remains , over these eight decades, we have work ed together for the 
greater good.   
 
From 51 Member States in 1945 to 193 today, the UN has 
established itself as the premier organization for multilateralism.  
In fact, it is difficult to imagine our world without the United 
Nations.   
However,  as it is with anniversaries, we must reflect honestly and 
candidly. Where are we at 80?  
 
 3 Conflicts are raging  as geopolitical tensions intensify , food 
insecurity  is worsening, displacement is growing, human rights are 
being ignored, and climate change is threatening lives and 
livelihoods .  
 
Our Sustainable Development Goals are imperiled  by shrinking 
development and budget support ! Spending on peacekeeping 
budgets is diminishing  and humanitarian costs are soaring.  
Meanwhile, global military spending  in 2024  saw its steepest 
annual increase since the Cold War .  
 
President,  
The U nited Nation s’ noble mission to maintain international peace 
and security will ring hollow if it allows power to  triumph over 
principle and might to override right.   
 
 
 4 In remaining faithful to its Charter, the United Nations must 
ensure that the survival and progress of humanity are not 
mortgaged to the ambitions of the powerful .  
 
The collective will of our membership  must be reflected in the 
institutions and governance structures of the United Nations , 
including the Security Council .  
 
It is precisely when the ideals of the United Nations are tested by 
horrific realities that the  collective must act in defence of the UN 
Charter  and international law .   
 
At present, a dark shadow looms over this 80th Session of the 
General Assembly ; Genocide in Palestine , annexation of Ukrainian  
territory, persecution of women in Afghanistan, humanitarian 
catastrophe  in Sudan, brutal gang violence in Haiti , increased  
transnational organized crime , trafficking  and illegal migration .  
 
 
 5 All this, as n ew challenges are emerging - cybercrime, cyber 
terrorism , and the pandemic of misinformation and 
disinformation , alongside the abuse of social media.  
 
President,  
Whilst we reiterate our condemnation of the attacks by Hamas on 
Israel on October 7, 2023 and again call for the immediate and 
unconditional release of all hostages , Israel’s actions  have long 
shattered any pretense  of legitimate self -defense.   What we are 
witnessing is not warfare, but mass extermination —a systematic 
slaughter  and displacement  of Palestinian men, women, and 
children.   Those  who escape the bombs and bullets are condemned 
to die slowly, starved of food, water, and hope.  This is  a war crime .    
 
The international community must not remain paralysed, while an 
entire people is annihilated .  Impunity must never  triumph over 
justice .  
 
 6 We must take urgent action to halt the genocide, return the 
hostages and  accelerate our efforts towards the Two -State Solution. 
We urge Qatar, Egypt and the United States to continue their 
efforts in this regard.  
 
Further, the situation in Ukraine remains of utmost concern. 
Guyana reiterates its call for an end to the Russia -Ukraine war and 
reaffirms its support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.  
 
Equally, the international community must act decisively in Haiti, 
where gang violence, displacement, and shortages of food and 
medicine have pushed the nation into deepening despair.   
Restoring security is the foremost priority, requiring strict 
enforcement of the arms embargo and robust support for a UN-
authorized mission.  
 
 
 7 I emphasize that without urgent humanitarian funding and a 
Haitian -led and owned political process , stability will remain 
elusive.  We must address the root causes of Haiti’s continuing 
troubles, including it s historical  debt burdens which stymies its 
development prospects and upliftment of its peoples. As President 
Macron acknowledged, making Haiti pay for its independence was 
unjust. This is a welcome step . 
 
President,  
Turning to my own country .  
Guyana, a small and peaceful state . We  have endured repeated 
threats and aggression  from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela . 
The territorial controversy  between our states  is now before the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) which has twice affirmed its 
jurisdiction , and which  in 2023, issued provisional measures 
ordering Venezuela to refrain from altering the status quo.   
 
 8 Yet, Venezuela persists with unilateral laws and threats of 
annexation , flagrantly violating international law, the UN Charter,  
and the very principles that sustain global order.    
 
If the rights of a small state can be trampled  upon , and legally 
binding orders ignored, what protection remains for any nation 
under international law?   Yet, Guyana continues to repose 
confidence in international law .  
 
For us, t he principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and non -
interference are not negotiable.  
 
We will not cower to  coercion, intimidation, or unilateral action.  
We thank our international partners and allies for their solidarity.  
  
 
 
 
 
 9  
President  
At 80, the time has come for a frank conversation on Cuba; One 
that would lead to the prosperity of its people , optimizing the full 
potential Cuba offers to its people and the rest of the world. Central 
to this dialogue is the lifting of the embargo on Cuba and its 
removal from the list as a State Sponsor of terrorism.  
 
Also important to our region is our collective effort against drug 
trafficking, human trafficking and illegal migration. We support 
efforts by the international community in addressing these crimes 
that are destroying the lives of our people , especially young people . 
 
The region must  continue to champion  effort s to enhance 
democracy, promote good governance and respect the will of the 
people in determining government s of their choice through free 
and fair elections . 
 
 
 10 President  
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration 
and Platform for Action . The declaration remains a blueprint for 
achieving gender equality which, despite transformative strides, 
remains significantly unrealized in most parts of the world.  
 
In Guyana, the dividends of strategic investments in  leadership and  
capacity building for women and girls, are evident.  More women 
have assumed leadership roles in government, in parliament and 
in public and private sectors.  
 
We have achieved gender parity in educatio n at all levels  and 
advanced the socio -economic  empowerment of women through  
land and home ownership  and diverse job opportunities  in 
traditional and emerging sectors.  
 
 
 11 To enable women  to participate equally and competitively in the 
workforce, government is offering childcare support  which will  
includ e day and night care centers  for children.  
 
President,  
Survival of our people, our economies, and our planet depen ds on 
accelerating action on the Sustainable Development Goals.  It 
requires a people -centered approach that prioritizes ending 
poverty and hunger, ensuring protection of children, support for 
persons with disabilities and empowerment of young people.  
 
Peace, stability, and sustainable development cannot exist in 
isolation from the urgent need to address climate change, which 
poses an existential threat to the most vulnerable and to our shared 
future.  
 
 
 12 Guyana repeats the call for accelerated,  unified global action to 
limit global warming . 
 
We continue to match our words with action s; protecting our 
forests, investing in sea and river defenses, improving drainage and 
irrigation, and restoring mangrove ecosystems to protect our 
people, our land, and our livelihoods.    
 
Our Low Carbon Development Strategy 2030  demonstrates that 
economic growth and environmental stewardship can advance 
hand in hand.   As the first country certified under the REDD+ 
Environmental Excellence Standard , and a successful seller of 
carbon credits, we are demonstrating  that nature has tangible value 
and that innovation and responsibility can be rewarded.  
 
We call on the international community to deliver predictable, 
accessible climate finance, to support adaptation and resilience, 
and to embrace nature -based solutions.  
 
 13 President,  
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Sustainable 
Development Goals.   Yet the slow pace of implementation and 
regression in many areas sound a stark warning that the promise 
of 2030 is at risk.   
 
Guyana calls for renewed global commitment to financing for 
development, including fulfilling Official Development Assistance 
pledges, mobilizing domestic resources, and addressing the 
crippling debt burdens that hinder progress in many developing 
nations.   
 
Addressing these development challenges requires recognizing 
that the health of our ecosystems is inseparable from the 
achievement of the SDGs . 
 
 
 
 14 Guyana proudly convened  the inaugural Global Biodiversity 
Alliance Summit in Georgetown in July 2025, uniting over 140 
countries, organizations, community groups, indigenous leaders, 
scientists, and financial institutions . The Georgetown Declaration , 
endorsed by this broad coalition of stakeholders, sends a clear and 
urgent message that biodiversity is a global public good, and its 
protection must be woven into national development plans, climate 
strategies, and financial frameworks.  
 
Building on the global  pledge to double protected areas by 2025 
and achieve the “30 by 30” goal by 2030, the Summit underscored  
the urgent need for innovative financing mechanisms including 
biodiversity credits, green bonds, debt -for-nature swaps to fund 
nature’s protection.  
 
Guyana is actively exploring biodiversity credits to create 
sustainable income streams for forest communities, building on 
our carbon credit success.   
 
 15 We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Yale 
Center for Biodiversity and Global Change to co -develop a National 
Biodiversity Information System, a digital backbone for data -
driven conservation.  
 
Guyana  is demonstrating that economic development and 
environmental stewardship can advance together.   By using natural 
gas as a bridge away from heavy fuel oil and investing in 
hydropower, solar, wind, and other renewables, we aim to lower 
electricity costs for our citizens and businesses while ensuring 
universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainabl e, and modern 
energy .  
 
Guyana is pursuing an ambitious  energy infrastructure and 
investment plan. While climate change is an existential threat, the 
reality is that the world still requires energy , sourced fro m 
petroleum to power growth and development , for which there is 
growing demand.   
 
 16 This is essential for the survival of our economies. AI and 
digitization are accelerating this demand at an extraordinary pace.  
 
As you are aware, Guyana is quickly becoming one of the world’s 
largest energy producers per capita, carefully balancing its green 
footprint with energy production.  
 
We will use our vast gas reserves , through a transformational gas 
to energy project . We will use this resource , taking  advantage of  our 
strategic geographic location to establish an AI hyperscale data 
center . 
 
Large AI data centers are rarely found in similar sized territories. 
As such, implementing a  project of this scale is of immense pride 
for Guyana. This investment will improve the competitiveness of 
our region, accelerate digitization, build out a fintech ecosystem, 
modernize the service delivery platform of government and 
accelerate private investment, bringing new job opportunities.  
 
 17 We recognize the  indispensable nature of AI  in our collective  
future. However, w hile there are immense benefits , there is no 
clarity on equity, access and applicability. Regulat ions, ethical 
standards and governance mechanism s are urgently needed. In 
this regard,  we welcome  the recent UN General Assembly decision 
to establish  two global AI governance mechanisms.  
 
President  
I now turn to food security.  Guyana is actively leading efforts to 
advance the CARICOM Agri -food Systems Agenda through “Vision 
2030,” aiming to boost food production, end hunger, and ensure 
food security across the Caribbean Community.  Our experience 
demonstrates tha t strategic investment and political will can 
transform national and regional food systems.  
 
Guyana calls for the transformation of global food systems to be 
more resilient, sustainable, and equitable by strengthening local 
production  and reducing dependence on volatile markets .  
 
 18 Guyana stands ready to share its experience and partner with 
others to ensure nutritious food for all.  
 
President  
As the United Nations commemorates its 80th anniversary, let us 
recall that this  Organization was conceived not in comfort but in 
crisis, forged from the ashes of war to serve as the conscience and 
compass of humanity.    
 
Eight decades later, that duty has not dimmed; it has only grown 
more urgent.    
 
If the UN is to remain humanity’s best hope, it must stand firm 
against aggression and remain fully engaged with the great 
questions of our time.  We must be bold in recognizing the necessity 
for institutional adjustments that will advance the organization’s 
success.  
 
 
 19 Our generation will be judged not by the eloquence of our 
declarations, but by the substance of our deeds.    From  the ruins of 
Gaza to the streets of Haiti, from K iev to the drowning coasts of 
small island states, the peoples of the world cry out for more than 
words.  
 
To honour eighty years of promise is to act with courage, to match 
principle with action , and to bind ourselves once more to the dream 
of a world united, not by fear or force, but by shared destiny and 
enduring hope.  
 
I thank you .
