1 Honorable President of the General Assembly,  
Honorable  Secretary -General,  
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  
Yesterday, the citizens of the Republic of Moldova made their 
choice in the most important election in our country’s history. 
They spoke with clarity, courage, and dignity. Despite 
unprecedented pressure, disinformation, and interference from 
the Kremlin, the Moldovan people defended democracy 
through free and fair elections.  
This was not merely a political contest. It was a test of 
resilience - of whether a small nation can withstand relentless 
attempts to destabilize, divide, and erode trust in its 
institutions. Moldova passed this test. Our citizens, from 
villages to cities, and from the diaspora who traveled 
thousands of kilometers to cast th eir ballots, stood united. 
They refused to be intimidated or deceived. This is a victory 
2 for the entire nation - a victory for democracy, for Europe, and 
for freedom.  
*** 
The Moldovan people have given a strong mandate for our 
European integration. They reaffirmed that our future lies in 
the European family - in peace, prosperity, and the rule of law.  
The European Union has been indispensable in Moldova’s 
progress. EU support has strengthened our economy, 
modernized our institutions, and helped us withstand external 
pressures - from energy blackmail to disinformation 
campaigns. Beyond assistance, Europe has provided us with a 
model: a community built on solidarity, justice, and the 
conviction that prosperity is best achieved together.  
We are grateful to our European and international partners 
who have supported Moldova’s resilience and democratic 
transformation. Their solidarity has made it possible for our 
3 people to resist external threats and to remain on the path of 
reforms - reforms in justice, governance, and the fight against 
corruption that are not only conditions for EU accession but 
also the foundation of a fair and accountable state.  
*** 
But let us be clear: this democratic choice was made against 
the backdrop of hybrid warfare. Interference began long before 
election day and will not end with it.  
Russia has sought to undermine Moldova’s sovereignty 
through illicit financing, disinformation, cyberattacks, and 
intimidation of voters. On election day itself, attempts were 
made to obstruct the diaspora vote, spread false narratives, and 
target electora l infrastructure.  
Our institutions - supported by civil society and independent 
media - stood guard and defended the sovereign will of our 
people. Yet national resilience is not enough. The threats we 
4 face are global. Democracies everywhere are being tested by 
increasingly sophisticated tools designed to manipulate 
information, erode trust, and distort elections.  
That is why Moldova calls for stronger cooperation to 
safeguard democracies. We urge this Assembly and UN 
members to join forces in protecting democracies from novel 
threats, with novel means.  
*** 
Moldova’s commitment to democracy is inseparable from our 
commitment to peace. We share a 1,200 km border with 
Ukraine, which continues to resist Russia’s brutal aggression. 
We know how fragile peace is, and we know why Moldova 
can stand here today in peac e: because Ukraine stands.  
We resolutely condemn Russia’s war of aggression. We 
support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within 
its internationally recognized borders, including its territorial 
5 waters. Every missile that strikes homes and civilian 
infrastructure violates international law. Accountability must 
follow, and Moldova supports the international community’s 
efforts to document and prosecute such crimes.  
This war is not only against Ukraine. It is a war against Europe, 
against freedom, and against the international order 
established by the United Nations Charter. Moldova will 
continue to stand with Ukraine and with all those who defend 
peace.  
*** 
The Republic of Moldova is committed to an exclusively 
peaceful reintegration, based on our sovereignty and territorial 
integrity within internationally recognized borders.  
We once again call for the complete, unconditional, and 
immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and ammunition 
from Moldovan territory, in line with Russia’s own 
6 international obligations. This withdrawal must be transparent 
and under international monitoring.  
*** 
Excellencies,  
Moldova’s election was a national choice - but its meaning is 
global. It showed that democracy can prevail even under 
relentless pressure. Yet democracies cannot stand alone. They 
need solidarity, resilience, and support.  
As the United Nations marks its 80th anniversary, Moldova 
reaffirms its commitment to the UN Charter. We support this 
Organization’s efforts to secure peace, advance the 
Sustainable Development Goals, address climate change, 
protect human rights, and estab lish global norms against 
corruption, disinformation, and foreign interference.  
Distinguished delegates,  
7 The people of Moldova have chosen freedom. They have 
chosen Europe. They have chosen peace.  
We are fully aware that consolidating our democracy and 
advancing toward EU membership will be a demanding 
journey - made more difficult by Russia’s persistent threats. 
But it is a journey we are determined to pursue.  
With unity at home and solidarity from our partners - above all 
the European Union and the United Nations family - we will 
continue to build a democratic, resilient, and prosperous 
Moldova: a Moldova that contributes to peace in Europe and 
to the work of this United Nations.  
Thank you.
