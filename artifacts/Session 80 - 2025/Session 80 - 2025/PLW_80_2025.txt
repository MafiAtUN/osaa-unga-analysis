President Surangel S. Whipps, Jr.  
United Nations General Assembly  
National Statement  
Sept. 25, 2025  
 
Madam President, Secretary -General, Excellencies, Distinguished 
Delegates,  
It is my great honor to address this Assembly at a milestone 
moment —the 80th anniversary of the United Nations.  
Eighty years ago, nations scarred by war came together to say 
“never again.” They built this Organization on the belief that 
cooperation, not conflict, could guide humanity forward. Today, 
as we reflect on that founding vision, let us remember: the United 
Nations was not built for the powerful, but for all nations — large 
and small alike.  
In Palau we have a saying: “Ng di sengsongd e mrecherchii a 
klengoes” —“Small twigs banded together can bring a pot to 
boil.” This wisdom reminds us that even the smallest among us, 
when united and determined, can drive meaningful change.  
The recent International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion 
affirms this truth, that our voice —though often overlooked —
carries the weight of justice. We thank Vanuatu for their 
leadership, and recognize the Pacific youth who co -led this 
charge.   

The advisory opinion confirmed what we have always known: 1.5 
degrees is not optional. It is now the benchmark for global action 
under international law. Let us defend this limit as the political, 
moral, and legal anchor of the Paris Agreement.  
The world is at war. Defense spending is at an all -time high, 
approaching 3 trillion annually! Small island states like Palau are 
also at war. Our shores are being invaded by seawater. Our 
homes are being blown away by storms. Our roads are being 
washed aw ay by torrential rain. Our reefs are overheating. Our 
fish are disappearing. And our land is on fire. This is our daily 
battle.  
Ahead of COP30 in Belem, we must see new Nationally 
Determined Contributions submitted particularly from major 
emitters, and they must be aligned with a 1.5 degree trajectory.  
We applaud Australia’s leadership in setting incredibly ambitious 
and achievable 2035 emissions reduction targets and developing 
clear strategies to reach its net -zero emissions pathway by 2050. 
Australia leads the way in supporting Pacific Island countrie s in 
accelerating the energy transition. This is a testament to the kind 
of leadership needed to defend and ensure a safe and 
prosperous future.   
Ambition without implementation is an empty promise. For SIDS, 
the fight also depends on climate finance. Too often our 
countries are trapped in systems that are overly complex, slow 
and inaccessible. Finance must be predictable and adequate. It 
should not create new debt, freeing us to implement our NDCs, 
adapt to climate change impacts, and address loss and damage. 
The 1.5 degree Celsius limit remains our lifeline, and finance is 
key to achieving it.   We need investment to combat our greatest 
threat. It i s not aspirational; it is the scientifically grounded 
guardrail that protects the most vulnerable from the worst of 
climate impacts.  
Madam President, our region has served as the world’s moral 
compass on climate justice. We helped secure the 1.5°C goal in 
Paris. We pushed for the mechanism on loss and damage.   
If the world is serious about 1.5°C, we urge you to come to our 
region, to see with your own eyes what the Pacific is facing and 
be moved to act.   
That is why COP31 must be a Pacific COP: hosted by Australia – 
shaped in partnership with the Pacific islands.  
Madam President, on the issue of climate solutions: deep -sea 
mining has been incorrectly promoted as a silver -bullet for the 
climate crisis. If we rush forward without understanding the 
consequences, we risk inflicting irreparable harm. The loss of 
biodive rsity, the release of carbon, damage to the water column, 
and the destruction of fisheries that sustain our people is 
unfathomable.  
At UNOC 3, 38 countries including Palau came together in 
support of a moratorium and our message is clear —we must let 
science guide us before we exploit the deep sea.  
The historic BBNJ Agreement enters into force in January. While 
Palau is proud to be the first ratifier, we couldn't have lit this fire 
alone. Like the Palauan proverb of the twigs — crossing the 
collective effort of over 60 countries demonstrates that we are 
better together. While we celebrate this achievement, we need 
even more nations to join this commitment to truly safeguard our 
ocean's future.  
Colleagues, the BBNJ Agreement presents an unprecedented 
opportunity to design new ocean governance institutions where 
SIDS have a voice from the start. We are big ocean states. And 
we call on our partners, including the EU, to support a SIDS seat 
in the B BNJ governance structure.  
Excellencies, the stakes for SIDS could not be higher — our 
economies are small, our vulnerabilities acute, and our fiscal 
space painfully narrow. The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for 
SIDS gives us a blueprint for resilient prosperity, but it cannot 
stand wi thout tools. That is why the Sevilla Commitment matters: 
the world has finally recognized that the financial system cannot 
be fair if it measures only income and ignores vulnerability.  
  
Multilateralism is our only shield, yet too often SIDS are 
sidelined, blacklisted, cut off from finance, and boxed in by rules 
we did not write. We demand a seat not as bystanders, but as 
equal architects of our shared future.  
  
We call for the full and immediate integration of the 
Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) into the policies and 
frameworks of international financial institutions, multilateral 
development banks and international organizations. It is time we 
move the MVI from theor y to practice.  
  
As we commemorate 80 years of this United Nations, we must 
look honestly at its strengths and its shortcomings. We welcome 
the Secretary -General’s UN80 initiative. But let me be clear: 
reform must not be cosmetic. This UN must be more responsive, 
more equi table, and more focused on solutions and delivery.  
 
Madam President, Palau knows too well the heavy cost of war, 
having endured the devastation of World War II on our islands. 
That history reminds us not only of the suffering left in the wake 
of conflict, but also of the sacred value of peace. Palau has 
always stood for the dignity of every human life and for the 
peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and respect for 
international law. Our positions, whether in support or restraint, 
are always guided by a deeper purpose — the pursuit of peace 
that is just, lasting, and stable. We believe that a durable solution 
— one that envisions two peoples, Israelis and Palestinians, 
living in two democratic states side by side, in peace, security, 
and dignity, within mutually recognized borders — is essential 
for a lasting peace. And we say with equal clarity: Russia’s 
unprovoked war against Ukraine is a stark reminder that when 
international law is disregarded, peace everywhere is placed at 
risk. It is only through respect for the rules -based order that all 
nations, large and small, can live in security.  
 
Continuing in that spirit of respect for life and stability, I must 
raise an issue of principle. Years ago, China wrongly interpreted 
UNGA Resolution 2758. Today, it continues to claim that Taiwan 
is part of the PRC, which results in the silencing of 23 million 
voices and keeping Taiwan from fully participating in the UN 
system and contributing to the world. Palau believes that 
inclusivity strengthens the United Nations, and that no 
community should  be barred from contributing to the solutions 
our world so desperately needs.   
  
Madam President, let me close with another Palauan proverb: 
“Dolch ra idis” — a rising tide lifts everyone. The choices we 
make together  are about lifting all of us, ensuring the next 
generation inherits a world that sustains them, just as it has 
sustained us.  
  
As we face today’s greatest challenges — climate change, ocean 
decline, debt, inequality, wars and conflicts — no nation can 
solve these issues alone. But together, guided by the spirit of the 
UN’s founding and strengthened by 80 years of hard -learned 
lessons, we can turn the tide.  
  
Let this Assembly be remembered not only for the words we 
speak, but for the actions we take — for the resilience we build, 
the justice we uphold, and the future we secure for generations 
yet to be born. We are better together.   
  
God bless you. Mesulang. Thank you.
