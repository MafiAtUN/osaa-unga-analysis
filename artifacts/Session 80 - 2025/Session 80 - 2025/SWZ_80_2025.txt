STATEMENT BY HIS MAJESTY KING MSWATI III, 
HEAD OF STATE OF THE KINGDOM OF ESWATINI, 
DURING THE 80TH UNITED NATIONS GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY, IN NEW YORK, USA.  
 
 
 
 
 
25TH  SEPTEMBER 2025  
KING’S OFFICE

YOUR E XCELLENCY, MADAM  PRESIDENT OF THE 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY,  
YOUR MAJESTIES,  
EXCELLENCIES, HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT,  
UN SECRETARY -GENERAL,  
DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES,  
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN . 
 
INTRODUCTION  
IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE TO ADDRESS THE 80TH 
SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
UNDER THE THEME, “BETTER TOGETHER: 80 YEARS 
AND MORE FOR PEACE, DEVELOPMENT, AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS.”  
 
AT THE OUTSET, WE WISH TO ASSURE YOU MADAM 
PRESIDENT OF ESWATINI’S UNWAVERING SUPPORT 
DURING YOUR TENURE. WE ALSO COMMEND T HE UN 
SECRETARY GENERAL  AND SECRETARIAT , FOR THEIR  
STEADFAST LEADERSHIP IN NAVIGATING OUR WORLD 
THROUGH UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES.  
3 
 
ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS  
AS WE GATHER T ODAY, MANKIND IS CONFRONTED  
WITH MANY CHALLENGES INCLUDING CONFLICTS 
AROUND THE WORLD . WE MUST REMIND OURSELVES 
THAT WHEN THE  UNITED NATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED 
IN 1945, IT WAS DURING A TIME OF WIDESPREAD 
GLOBAL STRIFE.  
 
ITS FOUNDING FATHERS  RESOLVED THAT NO COUNTRY 
OR PEOPLE SHOULD ENDURE SUFFERING DUE TO 
CONFLICT. THE UN CHARTER AND STRUCTURE WERE 
DESIGNED TO BE CLEAR AND RESO LUTE.  
 
NOW IS THE TIME TO ASK OURSELVES  WHAT H AS GONE 
WRONG AND WHAT STEPS MUST  BE TAKEN TO CORRECT 
THESE CHALLENGES AND RESTORE THE UN’S MISSION 
OF FOSTERING PEACE ? 
 
THE QUESTION WE MUST ASK OURSELVES  FURTHER  IS: 
WHAT IS THE UN DOING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES 
EFFECTIVELY?  
4 
 
I PROPOSE THAT THE UNITED NATIONS ESTABLISHES 
AD HOC COMMITTEES TO TACKLE GLOBAL CONFLICTS 
AND PROMOTE PEACE.  
 
THESE COMMITTEES SHOULD HAVE EQUITABLE 
REPRESENTATION IN DEALING WITH RELATIVE 
CONFLICTS IN THE DIVERSE REGIONS  OF HOT SPOTS 
INCLUDING AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, EUROPE, AND 
BEYOND  — ENSURING THAT ALL AFFECTED NATIONS 
HAVE A VOICE.  
 
SUPPORTED BY THE SECRETARIAT  OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS, THESE AD HOC COMMITTEES WOULD VISIT 
CONFLICT ZONES, ENGAGE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES, 
AND WORK TOWARDS PEACEFUL RESOLUTIONS.  
 
FOR EXAMPLE, IN AFRICA THE CONFLICTS IN SUDAN, 
SOUTH SUDAN, SOMALIA, THE SAHEL AND THE GREAT 
LAKES NEED THE INTERVENTION OF THESE AD HOC 
COMMITTEES.  
 
 
5 
 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE Y SHOULD  FACILITATE 
DIALOGUE WITH ALL PARTIES INVOLVED,  THE TEAM 
COULD  ASK THE PALESTINIANS WHAT IT  WILL TAKE TO 
RELEASE THE HOSTAGES, GIVEN THE FACT THAT  THE 
ISRAELIS WOULD REMAIN AG GRIEVED  AS LONG AS 
THEIR LOVED ONES ARE NOT WITH THEM.  
 
SIMILARLY THE AD HOC COMM ITTEE SHOULD ENGAGE  
THE ISRAELIS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT IT WOULD A LSO 
TAKE FOR THEM TO STOP THE B OMBARDMENT TO AVOID 
LOSS OF MORE INNOCENT LIVES, WIDESPREAD 
DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, AND A GROWING REFUGEE 
CRISIS.  
 
BY ENGAGING DIRECTLY WITH AFFECTED 
COMMUNITIES, THESE COMMITTEES COULD HELP 
BROKER SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF 
ALL SIDES, TO REDUCE TENSIONS, SUFFERING AND 
FOSTER STABILITY.  
 
 
6 
 
IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, 
THESE AD HOC COMMITTEES COULD MEDIATE 
DISCUSSIONS TO IDENTIFY PATHWAYS TO PEACE . 
THEIR ROLE WOULD BE TO  ENGAGE  IN MEANINGFUL  
DIALOGUE , AND REPORT BACK TO THE UNITED NATIONS 
WITH ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS  ON WHAT IT 
WOULD TAKE TO END THE WAR .  
 
IN E SWATINI  WE ENCOURAGE ENGAGEMENTS  THAT 
YIELD POSITIVE OUTCOMES PROVING THAT DIALOGUE 
IS THE CORNERSTONE IN NATION BUILDING.  
 
WE THANK THOSE COUNTRIES ALREADY MAKING MEANS  
IN FINDING SOLUTIONS. THIS SUGGESTED APPROACH  
IS NOT MEANT TO UNDERMINE THEIR EFFORTS, BUT IT  
WOULD COMPLEMENT THEM AS THEY  ARE ALREADY 
WORKING TOWARDS PEACEFUL RESOLUTIONS.  
 
WE MUST AVOID ACTIONS THAT COULD ESCALATE 
TENSIONS FURTHER AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON SAVING 
INNOCENT  LIVES .  
7 
 
MILLIONS OF  LIVES HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOST DURING 
THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC. WE THEREFORE, CANNOT 
AFFORD TO LOSE ANY MORE  TO CONFLICTS.  
 
THE UN MUST NOW FOCUS ON SUPPORT ING THE 
BUILDING OF  ECONOMI ES OF THE WORLD  TO ADDRESS 
ISSUES OF POVERTY AND THE GLOBAL FINA NCIAL 
CRISES , WHICH WE EXPERIENCED AFTER THE COVID -19 
PANDEMIC . BY INVESTING IN THESE AREAS, WE CAN 
CREATE CONDITIONS FOR LASTING PEACE.  
 
WE THEREFORE NEED ONE ANOTHER IN BUILDING AND 
SUPPORTING  OUR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN OUR 
RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. THE TIME FOR ACTION IS 
NOW. THE UN WAS ESTABLISHED IN PURSUIT OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PEACE, AND ITS MANDATE 
DATES BACK  DECADES.  
 
 
 
 
8 
 
IN 2025  AND ONWARDS , WE MUST RENEW OUR 
COMMITMENT TO THIS MISSION. BY FORMING THESE AD 
HOC COMMITTEES AND MAKING INFORMED, INCLUSIVE 
DECISIONS,  WE CAN WORK TOWARDS A WORLD WHERE 
PEACE PREVAILS, AND NO NATION OR PEOPLE SUFFER 
NEEDLESSLY.  
 
REFORM OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL  
WE HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF 
THE UNITED NATIONS AS A BODY REPRESENTING ALL 
MEMBER  STATES . IT MUST LEAD WITH DECISIONS THAT 
ARE INCLUSIVE AND WIDELY RESPECTED , AS NO ONE 
WILL QUESTION THE PROCESS TAKEN.   
 
THESE REFORMS SHOULD BE FULLY REPRESENT ATIVE 
OF ALL COUNTRIES THROUGH THE REGIONS OF THE 
WORLD IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO CREATE AN ALL -
INCLUSIVE STRUCTURE.  
 
WITHOUT SUCH REFORM, THE LEGITIMACY AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS BODY WILL REMAIN 
INCOMPLETE.  
9 
 
SUPPORT  FROM  OTHER  UN MEETINGS  
WE HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO WITNESS  UN HI GH 
LEVEL MEETINGS PRIOR  TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
BEING HELD TO ADDRESS VARIOUS ISSUES . THESE 
INCLUDE  THE SEVILLE AND AWAZA DECLARATION S ON 
FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT  AND SOCIO -ECONOMIC 
CHALLENGES FACED BY LANDLOC KED COUNTRIE S. 
 
WE ARE AWARE THAT FOR ANY GROWTH  TO TAKE 
PLACE, NATION S MUST HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES  TO 
ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS .  
 
BETTER TOGETHER – GLOBAL COOPERATION  
AS WE CONVENE TO ADVANCE INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATION, AND TO UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS FOR ALL, WE ARE REMINDED 
THAT OUR WORK IS BOTH URGENT AND 
INDISPENSABLE.  
  
 
 
10 
 
THE THEME “BETTER TOGETHER”  UNDERSCORES THE 
IMPERATIVE OF DELIVERING ON THE UNITED NATIONS 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND 
REINVIGORATING GLOBAL COOPERATION.  
 
ESWATINI CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT WORKING 
TOGETHER  REMAINS OUR MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR 
ADDRESSING GLOBAL CHALLENGES THAT TRANSCEND 
BORDERS.  
 
ACCELERATING PROGRESS TOWARDS SDG ’S 
THE WORLD STANDS AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN OUR 
PURSUIT OF AGENDA 2030. WITH ONLY FIVE YEARS 
REMAINING, WE MUST FACE THE REALITY THAT 
PROGRESS ON THE SDG’S IS FAR OFF TRACK.  
 
THIS IS A SOBERING REMINDER THAT OUR COLLECTIVE 
EFFORTS MUST BE REDOUBLED, AND THAT 
INTERNATIONAL SOLIDARITY, COOPERATION, AND 
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY ARE MORE URGENT THAN 
EVER BEFORE.  
 
11 
 
THROUGH MY NATIONAL CALL TO ALL EMASWATI OF 
NKWE , FOR A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE 
PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THE 
KINGDOM HAS MADE IMPORTANT STRIDES IN 
ADVANCING AGENDA 2030, PARTICULARLY IN THE 
AREAS OF THE ECONOM Y IN VARIOUS  SECTORS,  
HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND GENDER EQUALITY , TO 
MENTION A FEW.  
 
FURTHERMORE, THE COUNTRY’S LITERACY RATES HAVE 
IMPROVED, REFLECTING OUR INVESTMENTS IN 
EDUCATION, WHILE THE NATION CONTINUE S TO BE 
EMPOWERED THROUGH TARGETED PROGRAMMES THAT 
STRENGTHEN THEIR ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY AND 
ECONOMY.  
 
THESE ACHIEVEMENTS DEMONSTRATE WHAT IS 
POSSIBLE WHEN DETERMINATION AND PARTNERSHIP 
COME TOGETHER.  
 
 
12 
 
WHILE WE  HAVE WITNESSED THE GDP GROWTH OF OUR 
ECONOMY, WE REMAIN WITH A NUMBER OF 
CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS AND WE COUNT ON THE UN 
FOR SUPPORT TO  BECOME ONE OF THE ADVANCED 
ECONOM IES OF TH E WORLD.  
 
WE H AVE IMPLEMENTED INITIATIVES TO GROW OUR 
ECONOMY AND ATTRACT NEW IN VESTMENTS BY 
OPENING TRADING OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES  THAT GIVE ACCESS TO REGIONAL  AND 
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  
 
SOLUTIONS FOR  SUSTAINABLE FINANCING  
YOUR  EXCELLENCIES, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY REMAINS 
FRAGILE. PERSISTENT INFLATION RESULTING IN RISING 
FOOD AND ENERGY PRICES, AS WELL AS TIGHTENING 
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS , HAVE ERODED FISCAL SPACE 
FOR MANY DEVELOPING NATIONS.  
 
 
 
13 
 
ACROSS SUB -SAHARAN AFRICA, COUNTRIES SPEND ON 
AVERAGE 12 PERCENT OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES ON 
DEBT SERVICING, DIVERTING RESOURCES URGENTLY 
NEEDED FOR SOCIAL COHESION PROGRAMMES.  
 
ESWATINI ALSO ADVOCATES  FOR TRADE FACILITATION 
AND ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION, SIMPLIFYING 
CUSTOMS PROCEDURES, REDUCING REGULATORY 
BARRIERS, AND ENABLING GREATER PARTICIPATION IN 
REGIONAL AND GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS.  
 
IN THIS REGARD, THE AFRICAN CONTINENTAL FREE 
TRADE AREA (AFCFTA) HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BOOST 
INTRA -AFRICA TRADE BY UP TO 52 PERCENT, DRIVE 
INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS .  
 
FOR COUNTRIES LIKE ESWATINI, THE AFCFTA OFFERS 
MORE THAN MARKET ACCESS. IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY 
TO OVERCOME GEOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS THROUGH 
REGIONAL INTEGRATION, COOPERATION, AND 
EFFICIENT TRADE CORRIDORS.  
 
14 
 
HARNESSING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION  
IN AN INCREASINGLY CONNECTED WORLD, THE 
KINGDOM OF ESWATINI IS ACTIVELY STRIVING FOR 
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AS A CATALYST FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.  
 
ESWATINI IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS IN TECHNOLOGY  AND 
LOOK S FORWARD TO PARTNERING AND SHARING 
EXPERIENCES WITH OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN 
ADVANC ING OUR OWN TECHNOLOGIES.  
 
RIGHT TO HEALTH  
ESWATINI IS PROUD OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS 
ACHIEVED UNDER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 3. 
WE WELCOME THE PROGRESS MADE IN THE 
RATIFICATION OF THE PANDEMIC TREATY . 
 
THIS LANDMARK AGREEMENT IS ESSENTIAL FOR 
STRENGTHENING PREPAREDNESS AND RESILIENCE 
AGAINST FUTURE HEALTH EMERGENCIES, FOSTERING 
EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE COOPERATION .  
 
15 
 
WE REMAIN DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECLINE 
IN BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL SUPPORT FOR 
GLOBAL HEALTH PRIORITIES. WEAKENING OUR JOINT 
EFFORTS THREATENS TO ERODE DECADES OF 
PROGRESS IN THIS SECTOR , AS HEALTH IS GLOBAL 
SECURITY.  
 
DISASTER RESILIENCE  
THE KINGDOM OF ESWATINI RECOGNIZES THAT THE 
INCREASING FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF NATURAL 
DISASTERS,  EMERGENCIES, AND PROTRACTED CRISES , 
HIGHLIGHT THE URGENT NEED FOR INTEGRATED 
RESPONSES THAT BRIDGE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF, 
LONG -TERM DEVELOPMENT, AND PEACE BUILDING.  
 
WE URGENT LY NEED TO STRENGTHEN DISASTER 
PREPAREDNESS, BUILD RESILIENT COMMUNITIES, AND 
INTEGRATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE WITH SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT . 
 
 
 
16 
 
EMPOWERMENT FOR YOUTH AND WOMEN  
ESWATINI, LIKE  OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, 
HAS MANY YOUNG P EOPLE AND  MARGINALISED  GROUPS 
WHO FACE UNEMPLOYMENT AND INEQUALITY IN 
VARIOUS SECTORS .  
 
ENSURING  EMPOWERMENT , CAPACITY BUILDING  AND 
EMPLOYMENT IS OUR PRIORITY AND WITH THE SUPPORT 
OF THE UN PROGRAMME S WE ARE TAKING DELIBERATE 
STEPS TO PROVIDE A MORE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 
TO GUARANTEE  THEIR FUTURE .  
 
WE EQUALLY RECOGNIZE THE RIGHTS AND POTENTIAL 
OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, WHO CONTINUE TO 
FACE DISPROPORTIONATE BARRIERS TO EDUCATION, 
EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION  SO THAT 
THEY CAN FULLY CONTRIBUTE TO AND BENEFIT FROM 
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.  
 
 
 
 
17 
 
TAIWAN  
THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 
2758, ADOPTED IN 1971, DID NOT  ADDRESS THE ISSUE 
OF TAIWAN’S REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS , AND IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE THEIR 
PARTICIPATION IN THE UN SYSTEM.  
 
THE UNITED NATIONS MUST SEEK SUITABLE WAYS OF 
INCLUDING TAIWAN SO THAT SHE CAN BETTER 
CONTRIBUTE TO REALIZING THE UN SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT GOALS. IN THAT WAY, THIS WILL FULFIL 
THE UN MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT NO COUNTRY IS 
LEFT BEHIND . 
 
CONCLUSION  
MADAM  PRESIDENT , IN CONCLUSION, WE ARE 
ENTRUSTED WITH THE HOPES OF OUR PEOPLE AND THE 
FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN. LET US NOT LEAVE THIS 
ASSEMBLY WITHOUT REAFFIRMING OUR COMMITMENT 
TO JUSTICE, PEACE, AND SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS FOR 
ALL. THE KINGDOM OF ESWATINI STANDS READY TO 
PLAY ITS PART.   
18 
 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST REMAIN UNITED 
IN ADDRESSING SHARED GLOBAL CHALLENGES, FROM 
HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION TO CLIMATE CHANGE, 
UNDER THE GUIDING SPIRIT OF “BETTER TOGETHER.”  
 
I THANK YOU – MAY THE ALMIGHTY GOD BLESS US 
ALL.
