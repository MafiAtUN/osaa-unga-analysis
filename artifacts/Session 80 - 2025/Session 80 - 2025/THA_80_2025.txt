As delivered  
 Statement by H.E. Mr. Sihasak P huangketk eow 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand  
at the General Debate  of the  
80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
United Nations Headquarters, New York  
27 September 2025  
********  
Mr. President,  
Excellencies,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
 
1. At the outset, I would like to congratulate Madam President, on the 
assumption of the presidency of the 80th Session of the General Assembly.  
 
2. Though I assumed  office only a  few days ago , my government made it  
a priority for me to be here today  because we believe this moment matters . 
This 80th anniversary of the United Nations  comes  at a time when the UN is 
at a crossroads  facing critical challenges . 
 
3. Let me begin by reaffirming  Thailand’s steadfast commitment to 
multilateralism .  
 
4. There is no doubt that the world still needs the UN, and  
the UN needs all of us . But for the UN to fulfill its purpose, we must evolve 
with the changing times.   
 
5. Thailand, too, stands at an important crossroads , facing pressing 
challenges at home with no time to lose.  But our vision reaches beyond our 
borders, to the world at large.  For we, like all nations, aspire for a peaceful, 
just, and inclusive world.  
 
6. It is in this spirit that Thailand stands ready to play a constructive role in 
shaping a United Nations that is truly fit for purpose  — delivering peace, 
development, and human rights for all.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
7. This year’s General Debate theme  -- “Better Together” -- reminds us 
that the United Nations is strongest when we act together as One.  
 
One Community  
 
8. First, we must unite as One Community .  
 
 - 2 - 
9. Eighty  years ago, our community of nations adopt ed the UN Charter  
with hope for peace. Yet today, we face a world increasingly divided  — by 
protectionism, fragmentation, conflicts, and climate c hange that spares no 
nation . 
 
10. The war in Ukrain e, now in its third year, continues to bring immense 
suffering and destruction. Likewise, the horrendous suffering in Gaza, where 
innocent civilians , especially children , are paying the heaviest price, weighs 
heavily on our collective conscience.  It is a stark reminder that when peace is 
broken, the human cost is borne not only by nations, but by ordinary people 
whose lives are torn apart.  
 
11. As one community, every nation shares the responsibility to promote 
global peace and security .  
 
12. And this responsibility must be inclusive . Multilateralism is more 
effective when women participate fully  — whether in peacekeeping, conflict 
prevention, or humanitarian response. Their voices , leadership strengthen our 
community and make peace more durable. I am confident that Madam 
President’s election to lead this Assembly will inspire us all to advance the 
UN’s women agenda with greater resolve.  
 
13. Thailand intends to do our part . Our peacekeepers continue to serve 
around the world, helping to rebuild lives torn apart by conflicts.  
 
14. At home, we have cleared over 99 percent of mine -contaminated areas 
under the Anti -Personnel Mine Ban Convention . This is not just about treaty 
obligations , it is about giving communities back safe land they can live and 
grow on. It is about fulfilling our duty to our people . 
 
15. Protecting people at home is only part of the task. We must also respond 
to transnational challenges  like migration  driven by conflict and disasters ,  
a shared test no nation can solve alone.  
 
16. This is a real task for Thailand . For over  decades, we have hosted 
displaced persons from Myanmar. Today, we are giving them greater 
opportunities to work outside of their temporary shelters , so they can live 
with dignity and contribute to society  — a mark of our commitment to 
humanitarian assistance and practical solutions . 
 
17. In the same spirit, Thailand is stepping up our e fforts to combat 
transnational crimes , including online scams , as their impacts ripple far and 
wide.  Crime without borders demands cooperation without borders.  
 
 
 
 - 3 - 
18. The vision of One Community must begin close to home. Regions are 
the building blocks of the global community . In our region, peace and 
stability also lies at the heart of ASEAN’s Community -building efforts.  
 
19. Yet challenges exist even in our own neighborhood. The situation in 
Myanmar  remains a grave concern. Thailand has provided humanitarian aid 
along our borders, and we continue to urge all parties toward dialogue and  
a viable peace process.  This is the foundation for lasting peace in Myanmar.  
 
20. And even among closest neighbors , disputes can arise. Admittedly ,  
the current situation with Cambodia is neither desirable nor in the interests 
of either side.  Our peace, stability  and prosperity are closely intertwined.  
We cannot move away from one another. We are part of the same ASEAN 
family.  
 
21. This morning , I intended to say something different  and positive, 
reflecting hope for the future  but I had to rewrite the speech because of  
the most regrettable remarks by my Cambodia n colleague. To my dismay, 
Cambodia continues to present  itself as the victim . Time and time again,   
it has portrayed its own version of the facts, which does not hold up to scrutiny 
because it is simply a distortion of the truth.   
 
22. We know who are  the real victims : they are  Thai soldiers who have 
lost their legs  from  landmines, children whose schools were shelled, and 
innocent civilians who were shopping that day at the grocery store that came 
under  attack from Cambodian  rocket fire.  
 
23. Yesterday, I met my Cambodian colleague at the very hall of the United 
Nations. W e talked about peace, dialogue, mutual trust and confidence. This 
was emphasized  later at the informal 4 -party consultations  organized by the 
United States. We appreciate President Trump’s dedication to peace.  
 
24. But, unfortunately, w hat was said today by the Cambodia n side  was 
completely  opposite  to what was said yesterday at the meeting. It reveals the 
true intention of Cambodia. T he allegations were so far -fetched that they 
make a mockery of the truth.   
 
25. From the beginning, Cambodia initiated the conflict with the intention to 
expand a border dispute into a national conflict , and to further 
internationalize it as was the case again this morning.  
 
26. The villages referred to by  my Cambodia n colleague  earlier are in Thai  
territory , full stop.  In fact, they exist  because Thailand made the humanitarian 
decision to open up our borders in the late 1970s for hundreds of thousand  
Cambodian  fleeing the civil war in their country  to seek shelter  in Thailand . 
We made this decision out  of compassion and humanitarian principle s. As a 
young diplomat, I witnessed that scene myself.   
 - 4 - 
 
27. Although th e civil war  has ended and the shelters were closed,  
the Cambodian villages have expanded  over the decades. And d espite 
Thailand’s repeated protests, Cambodia has ignored those  requests to 
address  this encroachment . 
 
28. And w hen that  peace returned to Cambodia  after the 1991 Paris Peace 
Agreements , we were there to rebuild  and to rehabilitate the Cambodian nation 
to sustain peace . We buil t homes, roads  and hospitals because peace in 
Cambodia is in Thailand’s interest . This is what neighbor s should do for one 
another.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
29. The ceasefire is still fragile. We must make it work. This demands 
commitment  and sincere actions  from both sides . 
 
30. Regrettably,  Cambodia’s continued provocations , including the 
mobilization of civilians into Thai territory and recent firings toward our side , 
undermine peace and stability along the border. I am referring to a series of 
incidents since 23 September of Cambodian troops’ firing at Thai troops 
stationed along the border. The most recent incident happened just today . 
Thai troops have also continued to detect Cambodian surveillance drones, 
intruding into Thai territory on a daily basis across  the border areas. These 
actions constitute a violation of Thailand’s sovereignty and territorial 
integrity and the ceasefire a greement  reached at the special meeting in 
Putrajaya , Malaysia , and reaffirmed at the bilateral border committee 
meetings.  
 
31. And l et there be no doubt that Thailand has always, and will always 
stand for peace,  and will do everything we can to find a peaceful solution to 
the current problem with Cambodia. At the same time, Thailand will always 
stand firm and resolute in the defense of our sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.  We urge Cambodia to work with us in resolving differences through 
peaceful dialogue and existing mechanisms.  
 
32. Today, our two countries face a defining choice . As a close neighbor 
and as a friend, we must ask Cambodia which path they wish to take — the 
path of continued confrontation or the path of peace  and cooperation . 
 
33. Thailand chooses the path of peace because we believe that the people 
of both countries deserve no less.  But we really question whether it is the 
intention of Cambodia to join us in the pursuit for peace.   
 
 
 
 - 5 - 
34. For Thailand, dialogue, trust, and good faith are not just words — 
they are the way forward.  We will continue to uphold these principles in our 
engagements with partners in ASEAN and beyond, including major powers, in 
pursuit of sustainable peace and shared prosperity.   
 
35. To speak of One Community . Mr. President, is to reaffirm that we are 
bound by the shared principle that everyone is born free and equal in dignity 
and rights . 
 
36. As a member of the Human Rights Council for 2025 -2027 and Chair 
of the Third Committee of the General Assembly , Thailand is committed to 
promote and protect human rights for all.  
 
37. For us, it is not just about holding a seat at the table , it is about making 
a real difference in people’s lives : the lives of those caught in conflict, those 
living with disabilities, and those who are often left behind.  
 
38. Advancing the rights of women and girls  is also central to this effort. 
Equal participation and freedom from violence and discrimination are not just 
human rights — they are the foundation of just and resilient societies.  
 
39. Health is another fundamental right that cannot be overstated . 
Ensuring access to care is not only about saving lives — it is about giving 
every person the chance to live with dignity and security.  
 
40. This is why Thailand champions the right to health , at home and 
globally. Our Universal Health Coverage and Village Health Volunteers 
put people first so that no one is left behind, and every community is given the 
tools to thrive.  
 
41. Thailand is also contributing to global efforts on non-communicable 
diseases and pandemic preparedness , including through the WHO 
Pandemic Agreement . We do not know when the next pandemic will strike, 
and only by working together can we be prepare d and ready.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
42. Peace and human rights cannot stand without sustainable development.  
Yet today, development is under threat from rising  protectionism. Tariffs and 
trade barriers may serve short -term interests, but they hurt us all in the long 
run and  divide us when we need the most solidarity.  
 
43. Thailand believes that t rue prosperity is built not on walls of tariffs, 
but on bridges of trust.  
 
 - 6 - 
44. Our path forward is open and fair trade rooted in people -centered and 
inclusive development. But sustainable development is not just growth — it is 
also about values and the balance between progress and preservation .  
 
45. This is why Thailand’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy , built on 
balance, resilience, moderation, has guided our development journey.  
It reminds us that true progress must empower people  while protecting  
the planet.  
 
46. With only five years left to achieve the SDGs, we must strengthen 
partnerships at all levels  and confront the inequalities and financing gaps  
that still hold back our common future.  
 
47. At the same time, we must never forget that the planet lies at the core of 
sustainable development. Climate change , the overarching threat of our time , 
is widening the gap between the haves and have -nots. Without stronger  
support for those most affected, we will fail both our people and our planet.  
 
One Dedication  
 
Mr. President,  
 
48. As the UN turns 80, our task is simple but profound: to come together 
under One Dedication . 
 
49. We are all bound by ideals, norms, and principles  of the UN Charter. 
But the world has changed dramatically. Renewing our dedication  to 
multilateralism is no  longer  optional . 
 
50. But t he truth is, the history of the UN is filled with promises made but 
not kept . Each unfulfilled pledge erodes credibility and weakens global trust. 
If the UN is to remain  at the heart of multilateralism, we cannot afford to 
repeat this cycle.  
 
51. That is why the Pact for the Future , adopted last year, must become  
a blueprint for action . To deliver meaningful progress, our national actions 
must match our collective pledges.  
 
52. But for the UN to effectively deliver on its tasks , it must be equipped 
with the resources it needs. We must ensure the UN has the means to 
achieve the ends it has been mandated to undertake , so that the UN can 
remain a driving force for peace and development.  
 
 
 
 
 
 - 7 - 
One Future  
 
Mr. President,  
 
53. As we seek to rebuild, reinvigorate and reform  the UN, we must be 
guided by the vision of One Future .  
 
54. For the UN to guide us into the future, comprehensive reforms , 
including the Security Council , are imperative . The UN must be more 
representative, transparent, accountable, and also fit for the future : coherent 
in action, relatable to people, and adaptive to change.  
 
55. That is why Thailand strongly supports the UN80 initiative . It is not just 
about closing the financial gaps, but a once -in-a-lifetime chance  to make  
the UN reconnect with the people it serves . 
 
56. But as we strengthen the UN, we must recognize its limits. The UN 
cannot do everything, and multilateralism is bigger than the UN alone .  
It thrive s when rooted in strong regionalism. Regional institutions are  
the first responders to crises, the builders of trust among neighbors, and the 
bridge between global commitments and local realities.  
 
57. For Thailand, ASEAN is our home and our center . The upcoming 15th 
ASEAN –UN Summit  will show how shared principles become practical 
cooperation . Thailand is fully committed to advancing this partnership, so that 
regional voices are fully heard in shaping global solutions.  
 
58. Building a strong global community goes beyond our generation. That is 
why we must embrace the power of youth . Marking the 30th anniversary of 
the World Programme of Action for Youth , Thailand reaffirms its 
commitment to invest and empower young people and give them real 
opportunities to drive change.  
 
59. With this in mind, Thailand is proud to have youth delegates joining 
our national delegation to the UNGA , so they can actively participate in 
shaping the future they envision.  
 
60. For in the end, the future belongs to them . It should, therefore, be built 
by them . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 - 8 - 
Mr. President,  
Excellencies,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
 
61. In its 80th year, the United Nations must live up to its very name -- 
Nations that stand United . We gather here not only in celebration of what has 
been achieved, but to look ahead to what more we can accomplish together.  
 
62. The lesson of eighty years is clear: we are strongest when we stand as  
One Community , bound by  One Dedication , and united in shaping   
One Future for All . This is the true meaning of  Better Together as One.  
 
63. Thailand pledges to do our part. But more than that — we challenge 
ourselves, and all our friends here today, to turn words into deeds. That is 
how we will make the next eighty years better than the last.  
 
Thank you  very much.
