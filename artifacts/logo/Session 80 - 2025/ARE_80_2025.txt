Madam President,  
When the world stood amidst  the ruins of war eighty years ago, it faced a watershed 
moment  - one that required  a transition to a new order. With the previous 
international systems having  failed to maintain international peace and security , the 
world was faced with  a choice. It  chose peace and embrace d a new era of 
international cooperation and solidarity , embodied by the establishment of this 
Organization.  
Today, we once again face a pivotal moment . Today, t he world is marked  by turmoil, 
conflict, and humanitarian crises . Threats to state sovereignty, proliferation risks  and 
extremist ideologies persist, undermining  the foundations of stability and 
development.  
Amidst these challenges , my country has chosen the path of  prudence  and de -
escalation, leveraging  its capabilities to build bridges, prevent  conflicts, and place 
the interests of humanity above all. We have  sought to strengthen the mechanisms 
for international cooperation  and multilateral ism, as well as the  norms and principles 
of the UN Charter and international law . In doing so, the UAE promote s the 
principles of good neighbo urliness  and respect for sovereignty of states , to create  
opportunities and advance progress in every  field.

My country has also championed  genuine humanitarian diplomacy , aimed at 
preserving the dignity of individuals in the most difficult circumstances. We have 
sought to bridge divides ; facilitating  the exchange of thousands of prisoners between 
Russia and Ukraine, hosting peace talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia,  and 
undertaking efforts to de -escalate tensions in South Asia and beyond . 
In the face of these global challenges , the United Arab Emirates  remains  committed 
to diplomacy, peaceful solutions, and dialogue . Our aim is  not simply  to manage 
conflicts  but to resolve them  sustainably. The urgent need for this approach is clear 
around the world , whether in  the Gaza Strip , Ukraine, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, or the 
Sahel .  
Many of the crises around us have been exacerbated by extremist ideolog ies, hate 
speech, and incitement. That is why we are leading efforts to advance the "Tolerance, 
Peace, and Security" agenda  - to uphold the values enshrined in the UN Charter and 
to break cycles of conflict.  
There is no doubt that what we are witnessing today in the Palestinian -Israeli conflict 
is not only a result of, but serves  extremists and warmongers  efforts , who seek to 
undermine the path to  a peaceful resolution. No thing can justify targeting tens of 
thousands of civilians,  or besieging, starving and forcibly displacing hundreds of 
thousands ; nor can anything excuse t he pursuit of  unacceptable expansionist 
ambitions, including the threat of annexing the West Bank.  
Similarly, there is no justification for the taking of hostages or the targeting of 
civilians in conflict . International law, including international humanitarian law, 
must be respected.  
This situation also cannot serve  as an excuse to attack countries in the region . Israel ’s 
treacherous and reprehensible  attack against the State of Qatar  constituted a flagrant 
violation of its territorial integrity and of  the security of the Arabian Gulf region, as 
well as a breach of the most fundamental principles of international law . Aggression  
will not bring stability to the region.  
My country  has always believed in the centrality of the two -State solution and the   
realization  of an independent, sovereign Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its 
capital, living side by side with the State of Israel , in security, peace and prosperity . 
This is a fundamental requirement for achieving a permanent, just, and 
comprehensive solution to this issue  – with a Palestinian State capable of fulfilling 
 
3 
 
the aspirations of the Palestinian people,  restricting the use of weapons, and ensuring 
security, stability, and the rule of law , with no place for terrorist and extremist 
groups.  
My country welcomes the growing recognition of the State of Palestine . We invite  
other s to follow this approach  as an investment in a better future for the region.  
Our first and most urgent demand s remain an immediate and permanent ceasefire in 
Gaza, ending  the siege on Gaza , releasing  the hostages and detainees, and urgent , 
unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid  at-scale . The UAE continues its role as the 
largest donor of aid to Gaza, mobilising  all its relations, resources, and capabilities 
to this end. We will continue to deliver aid  to those most in need , despite  restrictions 
and obstacles.  
As part of our commitment to prioritizing diplomatic solutions and justice in the 
international system, my country continues to place the dispute  of the three occupied 
Emirati islands  in the Arabian Gulf —Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa —
at the forefront of its national priorities. We continue to call on Iran to end its 
occupation of these islands, which are an integral part of UAE territory, as well as 
to respond to our repeated calls to resolve this dispute through direct negotiations or 
by resorting to the International Court of Justice.  
We also  reiterate  here our full support for Moroccan sovereignty over the Moroccan 
Sahara  and endors e the Autonomy Initiative within the framework of Moroccan 
territorial integrity.  
 
Madam President,  
The brutal  scene unfolding in Gaza  is not the only crisis  engulfing  our region . In 
Sudan, people are experiencing immense human suffering  and famine. My country 
stands with the Sudanese people , supporting  their aspirations to end th is civil war 
and its profound humanitarian consequences . We underscore the importance of the 
statement  by the Quad  on Sudan and the call for a humanitarian truce . We stress the 
importance of reaching an immediate ceasefire and ensuring unhindered access for 
humanitarian aid throughout the country.

Sustainable peace cannot be achieved through military solutions. A transitional 
process must be pursued in Sudan, leading to an independent civilian government, 
one that is not control led by any of the warring parties , and which denies space to  
extremism and terrorism.  
 
Madam President,  
My country is committed to supporting the role of international organizations and 
multilateral institutions . There is  an urgent need to develop and reform the existing 
institutions for collective action , especially the UN and Security Council  in 
particular . The UAE views the UN80 initiative as an opportunity to both strengthen 
the Organization's capabilities and  ensure  a clear vision for its work in the decades 
ahead.  
This vision of UN reform is consistent with the UAE's ambitious national approach , 
under the wise leadership  of His  Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, 
President of the UAE , may God protect him. It is a vision for an effective and 
equitable international system capable of serving humanity and working collectively 
to achieve comprehensive and sustainable prosperity . 
This is reflected across  the UAE’s policies.  Regarding the  econom y and  
development, we have doubled our foreign investments in various projects . We have  
expanded the scope of our partnerships  deliver ing shared prosperity, particularly 
with the Global South . This includes  in Africa , where our investments have extended 
across  various sectors, reflecting our  belief in the importance of openness and 
engagement to achieve shared development  prosperity , and stability . 
In the fields of science , technology, and Artificial Intelligence, my country has 
sought to harness the se tools  to advance sustainable development around the world . 
We support  countries  to build their technolog ical capacit ies, while respecting their 
national values and priorities, and ensuring the responsible and ethical use of these 
technologies in accordance with international law.  
As for  our ongoing efforts to protect our planet , the  UAE is accelerating its  
invest ments  in international climate action, supporting innovative solutions to 
achieve an orderly and responsible energy transition and promote clean energy.

My country affirms its full commitment to implementing the outcomes of the "UAE 
Consensus " from COP28 held in Dubai  in 2023 .  
My country is also invest ing heavily in addressing the challenges of water scarcity, 
including through the Mohamed bin Zayed Water Initiative, which supports the 
development and application of pioneering technologies to promote sustainable 
access to  this important resource . 
As we prepare  to host the UN Water Conference next year with the Republic of 
Senegal, we will seek to strengthen international cooperation on this issue and 
stimulate investment in innovation .  
And in  all our projects and initiatives, we seek to promote the full, equal, and 
meaningful participation of women, as essential partners in society.  
 
In conclusion, Madam President,  
At a time when  our international institutions are weakened and the principles  of 
international law  are undermined, we must live up to our  shared responsibility to 
ensure the continuity of our international system , to restore its credibility , and  to 
secure  a better future for  generations  to come . 
 
Thank you, Madam President .
