1 BURKINA FASO FOURTIETH ORDINARY SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS ξ≈ ξ≈ ξ≈ ξ≈ ξ≈0≈ξ≈ ξ≈ ξ≈ ξ≈ ξ DECLARATION OF HIS EXCELLENCE MR. RIMTALBA JEAN EMMANUEL OUEDRAOGO PRIME MINISTER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT New York, September 27, 2025 (Check for delivery) Permanent Mission of Burkina Faso to the Nations United Permanent Mission of Burkina Faso to the United Nations 2 Madam President, Mr. Secretary General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the distinct honor and great privilege to speak on behalf of Comrade President, Captain Ibrahim TRAORÉ, President of Faso, Head of State, on the occasion of this session, in order to carry the voice of the dignified and honest people of Burkina Faso. Therefore, he instructs me to send his fraternal greetings to all citizens of the world who love peace and freedom. 3 Madam President, I extend to you, on behalf of Burkina Faso, my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of this 80th session. Your election confirms the confidence of the international community in your leadership, and your sense of listening and dialogue. You will find in my country a sincere, constructive and committed partner. To your predecessor, Mr. Philémon YANG, I express my gratitude for the quality and rigor of the work accomplished during the 79th session. Madam President, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, Burkina Faso fully subscribes to the statement delivered on behalf of the Confederation of Sahel States (AES) by the sister Republic of Mali. Together with Niger, we have a community of purpose and aspirations in a space of renewal and rupture. 4 Mr. Secretary General, Burkina Faso would like to salute the contribution of the United Nations system and its partners in our common quest for stability and prosperity. This session, which is being held eighty years after the adoption of the Charter of the United Nations, constitutes an ideal opportunity to mark a pause and take an uncompromising assessment of our organization. It is this reflection that the theme offers us: “Better together: more than 80 years in the service of peace, development and human rights”. If it is part of the perspective of renewing our mutual commitment in favor of a world more focused on equity and justice, and a more effective multilateralism, this theme reflects the ideal approach which should guide each nation, each sub-regional, regional and international grouping. 5 These “Oak Weddings” which should embody a time of solemn celebration rather call for deep introspection. The results of eight decades of the United Nations, far from arousing joy, are more akin to an “embarrassing fiasco”, “collective disillusionment” and “structural failure”. Since the duty of truth invites us to do so, we must recognize with humility that although the overall picture presents some achievements, it remains negatively marked by eight decades of hard-tested optimism, eight decades of disappointed hopes, eight decades of shattered dreams, in short...eight decades of missed crucial meetings. It is unfortunately the obscure image of a UN that many of our predecessors of 1945, if they were still alive, would have found it difficult to accept. It is therefore difficult to rejoice in the face of such mixed results. 6 How can we understand that Africa, the cradle of humanity and home to so many conflicts, representing more than a billion human beings, remains excluded from the decision-making bodies of the Security Council? How can we accept that peacekeeping missions, financed with billions, leave our countries, leaving more frustration and suffering than tangible results? The causes of this “collective shipwreck” are, however, known to everyone, particularly to the Member States themselves who, during these eight decades, have, within the framework of the General Assembly, devoted their energies to defending noble causes and proposing realistic reforms without winning the cause. 7 What can we do if the decisions of the General Assembly, which are not binding, make it congenitally inaudible and inefficient? Could we hope for a better record with a Security Council sick of the politicization of its decisions, impotent because of its inconsistencies and inefficient because of its permanent divisions? Worse still, this Council, with its role today overused, presents itself as a great troublemaker for the tacit, sneaky and sometimes active complicity of some of its permanent members, themselves major players and main financiers of the crises of our time. This is what our Security Council has become, a “enterprise” – it must be said – “disastrous” which, due to the predatory aims of some of its permanent members, can among other things decide which country will be on the agenda of the 8th day of international terrorism, in which other to send peacekeeping operations, as if to better legitimize its role. It is therefore powerless that we witness the failures of initiatives that are nevertheless judicious due to rivalries between States and unresolved crises, the most emblematic of which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which has lasted too long. The culpable inaction of the international community in the face of defiance of State authority by terrorists financed and supported by other States adds to all these worrying paradoxes. The time for a start and courageous reforms has come. Without this, the Security Council will remain an anachronistic institution, incapable of responding to the challenges of our time. 9 Ladies and gentlemen In a world in profound change, marked both by the rise of digitalization and the persistence of geopolitical tensions, it is becoming imperative to rethink our economic development strategies. International trade can no longer be understood through the rigid and unbalanced patterns that have been imposed on us, but must be reoriented towards the strengthening of economic autonomy, the local transformation of resources and the promotion of real social justice. It is now recognized that sustainable prosperity requires proactive industrialization policies, local valorization of our raw materials and the creation of decent jobs, particularly for our youth. This is why it is urgent to break with the cycle of dependence on exports of raw products, a model which increases the vulnerability of our economies and inexorably slows down our emergence. 10 In Burkina Faso, presidential initiatives reflect this firm desire to build a productive, inclusive and resilient economy, capable of offering new perspectives to our fellow citizens. It is in this sense that my country reaffirms its commitment to building a fairer and more equitable multilateral trading system, based on international solidarity and taking full advantage of scientific, technological advances and innovation, real levers of sustainable and shared development. Madam President, My country, like other nations of the Sahel, is going through one of the most difficult trials in its history. For almost a decade, Burkina Faso has been attacked by terrorists supported by dark forces. 11 These groups covet our resources, seek to break our sovereignty and impose the law of chaos. But far from giving in, we have chosen dignity and resistance. Under the leadership of Comrade President, Captain Ibrahim TRAORÉ, we have decided to take our destiny into our own hands: • By mobilizing our Defense and Security Forces, supported by Volunteers for the Defense of the Fatherland, true everyday heroes; • By establishing the Patriotic Support Fund, funded by voluntary contributions from our citizens, our diaspora and friends of Burkina Faso throughout the world. Since 2023, this Fund has already collected more than 413 billion FCFA, resounding proof of the unity and patriotic upsurge of our people; 12 • By undertaking historic reforms to achieve food sovereignty, rehabilitate our lands, revive our agricultural production and reduce our dependence on imports. These efforts made by an entire determined people are bearing fruit: more than 72% of our territory has been reconquered, thousands of internally displaced people are returning to their communities, schools are reopening, social services are coming back to life. Burkina Faso thus demonstrates that a united and standing people can overcome the toughest challenges. In any case, Burkina Faso reaffirms, with full responsibility, that its priorities are not negotiable and that its choices must be respected more than ever. Ladies and gentlemen 13 We base our action on the virtues of solidarity and unity, with the deep conviction that a people united around a common ideal can accomplish great things. The combined efforts of our fellow citizens from within and from the diaspora, and their enthusiastic support for the dynamic, reassure us in the correctness of the choices we have made, under the leadership of Comrade President of Faso. The enthusiasm generated by the Patriotic Support Fund (FSP) and the “Faso Mêbo” Presidential Initiative is the perfect illustration of this. Established in 2023, in support of the Action Plan for Stabilization and Development (PA -SD), the Patriotic Support Fund aims to mobilize, endogenously, additional national resources in order to strengthen our defense and strategic investment capabilities. 14 This Fund has attracted massive support, both within the country and within our diaspora. Madam President, The methodical pursuit of our reforms allows us to welcome today major advances in economic governance: better control of public spending, optimized management of State human resources, rationalization of institutional costs and maintenance of viable debt. These efforts are also perceptible in the more equitable redistribution of national wealth, so that the abundant resources of our territory fully benefit the citizens who work for the development of the country, and not external interests or their internal relays. Despite the difficulties inherent in the security and humanitarian crisis, government actions, covering all sectors of socio-economic development, have recorded notable successes. 15 Ladies and gentlemen This is why we are surprised by the condescending postures of certain UN agencies, which allow themselves to interfere in our national debate through biased narratives disconnected from realities on the ground. We firmly reject the report entitled “Children and the armed conflict in Burkina Faso”, peppered with untruths and whose very title is a semantic manipulation. I would like, on this occasion, to salute the courage of our fighting forces and pay tribute to the civilian and military martyrs who fell on the field of honor in the defense of our sovereignty. Madam President, We have always proclaimed it: terrorism has become the well-found pretext of certain States to despoil African resources. 16 Thus, our countries find themselves confronted with terrorists who are, in reality, only auxiliaries of predatory foreign armies. Some States, moreover, no longer even hide from publicly claiming the support they provide to these criminals. This is the case of France, of the MACRON regime, whose public media, in addition to daily disinformation, have become communication relays for criminals responsible for cowardly and barbaric attacks perpetrated against peaceful citizens. On this subject, we renew our appeal regarding the follow-up to the request sent on August 20, 2024 by the member states of the Confederation of Sahel States to the Security Council, which remains, to date, unanswered. This persistent silence adds to the discredit of the institution and leaves doubt about implicit complacency. 17 Even more worrying, certain members of the Security Council continue to trample resolution 1373 (2001), although binding, which imposes the repression of the financing of terrorism, the strengthening of border controls and increased international cooperation. In the Sahel, we have taken note of this reality and adapted our security measures to this situation, while revising our terms of cooperation with certain countries. Madam President, We remain convinced that the United Nations must remain a central framework for dialogue and cooperation. But we call for a renewed partnership, based on mutual respect, equality and sincere solidarity. 18 Ladies and gentlemen Faced with common threats and external interference, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger joined forces to found the Confederation of Sahel States (AES). The AES is not a withdrawal, much less a closure. It is an affirmation: the affirmation of our right to self-determination, to define our priorities and to build regional cooperation in the exclusive service of our peoples. • It is a choice of dignity. • It is the refusal of a system where our countries too often served as maneuvering grounds for external agendas. • It is the desire to be the main actor in our history and to write the future of our children ourselves. 19 The AES is part of the continuity of the fight of pan-Africanist figures such as Thomas SANKARA, Patrice LUMUMBA or Kwame N’KRUMAH. Today, a new generation of leaders takes up this torch, with the firm conviction inspired by the father of the Revolution of August 1983 that “only the struggle liberates”. Madam President, Africa, for eight decades, has legitimately claimed its place on the Security Council. It is time to fundamentally reform our Organization. More concretely, it involves: • implementing a courageous reform of the Security Council, by granting Africa permanent representation; • improve resource management, to make the UN more effective and closer to the people it claims to serve; 20 • to firmly tackle the structural causes of international injustice, whether instrumental terrorism, the blockade against Cuba, sanctions against Venezuela or the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the particular case of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we reaffirm our unwavering support for this people who have suffered for decades from campaigns of isolation, illegal sanctions and incessant provocations. Faced with this blatant interference in the sovereign affairs of a nation and this economic aggression with disastrous humanitarian consequences, we express our solidarity with this country which resists with dignity to preserve its right to choose its own destiny, without ultimatum or foreign diktat. We therefore call for reason and diplomacy to stop any hostile action against Venezuela. 21 Mr. Secretary General I would now like to address you. It is really time for our organization to change paradigm, because the UN today finds itself in the same situation as the defunct League of Nations. She is incapable of imposing her voice and enforcing her own principles, incapable of enforcing her decisions and resolutions to the powerful, incapable of enforcing international law, incapable of resolving multiple conflicts and incapable of evolving and adapting to current challenges. Mr. Secretary General You have a great opportunity to make history, by taking responsibility for a profound transformation of this organization which at its creation aroused so much hope. You have the firm support of millions of citizens of the world to make this organization a true guarantor of peace and security in the world and not an instrument of domination in the hands of the strongest of the moment. Despite the various pressures and power games, we know you are ingenious enough to free the United Nations organization and place it at the height of our common ambitions. Madam President, Addressing development issues, Burkina Faso welcomes the holding of the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development and hopes that the conclusions of the Seville meeting can contribute to the advent of a more equitable financial architecture, respectful of the sovereignty of States and supporting a real transformation of developing countries. 23 In the same vein, it remains imperative to tackle the factors which constitute an obstacle to the full achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), supposed to positively transform our world under the aegis of the United Nations. Ladies and Gentlemen, Eighty years after the Charter of the United Nations, our Organization is far from having lived up to the hopes of 1945. Eighty years later, the world is full of injustice and suffering and the risks of another generalized conflict are becoming clearer and are sources of concern for the future. But it is not too late to give our common home the momentum it lacks. 24 Burkina Faso, faithful to its pan-Africanist heritage, reaffirms its faith in a renewed, fair and equitable multilateralism. We are determined to defend our sovereignty and our dignity, but we extend our hand to all nations loving justice, freedom and solidarity. Long live the reformed and credible United Nations! Long live the Confederation of Sahel States! Long live Burkina Faso, worthy, sovereign and standing! Homeland or Death, We Will Win! Thank you.
