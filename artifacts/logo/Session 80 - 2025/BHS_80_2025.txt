Madam
 
President
 
Annalena
 
Baerbock,
 
We
 
offer
 
our
 
warm
 
congratulations
 
on
 
your
 
election
 
to
 
preside
 
over
 
this
 
eightieth
 
session
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly,
 
and
 
we
 
thank
 
your
 
predecessor
 
His
 
Excellency
 
Philémon
 
Yang
 
for
 
a
 
job
 
well
 
done.
 
 
 
Excellencies,
 
 
Distinguished
 
Delegates,
 
 
Ladies
 
and
 
Gentlemen:
 
 
2
 
In
 
celebrating
 
80
 
years
 
of
 
the
 
global
 
community
 
in
 
coming
 
together
 
in
 
this
 
United
 
Nations,
 
we
 
must
 
remind
 
ourselves
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
got
 
here.
 
 
The
 
United
 
Nations
 
was
 
not
 
born
 
out
 
of
 
some
 
high-minded
 
ideal,
 
or
 
because
 
humanity
 
suddenly
 
decided
 
to
 
promote
 
its
 
collective
 
virtue.
 
 
No
 
–
 
the
 
UN
 
was
 
created
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
ashes
 
of
 
a
 
period
 
when
 
humanity
 
had
 
almost
 
destroyed
 
itself.
 
3
 
 
The
 
blood-soaked
 
trenches
 
of
 
the
 
First
 
World
 
War,
 
brought
 
about
 
by
 
the
 
rivalries
 
between
 
the
 
great
 
powers
 
of
 
the
 
day.
 
 
The
 
collapse
 
of
 
the
 
League
 
of
 
Nations,
 
made
 
im-po-tent
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
refusal
 
of
 
the
 
major
 
powers
 
to
 
participate.
 
 
The
 
despair
 
of
 
the
 
Great
 
Depression.
 
The
 
rise
 
of
 
fascist
 
ambition,
 
which
 
led
 
to
 
the
 
devastation
 
of
 
the
 
Second
 
World
 
War.
 
4
 
 
The
 
terror
 
of
 
atomic
 
weapons.
 
 
These
 
are
 
the
 
foundation
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
Nations.
 
 
Over
 
one
 
hundred
 
million
 
died,
 
many
 
more
 
driven
 
into
 
poverty.
 
 
I
 
recite
 
these
 
histories
 
because
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
world
 
we
 
wish
 
to
 
return
 
to.
 
We
 
are
 
in
 
danger
 
of
 
being
 
doomed
 
to
 
repeat
 
the
 
brutal
 
lessons
 
of
 
history.
 
5
 
When
 
nations
 
go
 
their
 
separate
 
ways,
 
history
 
teaches
 
us
 
that
 
disaster
 
eventually
 
follows.
 
When
 
nations
 
stand
 
together,
 
survival
 
and
 
prosperity
 
become
 
possible.
 
 
With
 
the
 
stench
 
of
 
the
 
atomic
 
firestorms
  
still
 
hovering
 
over
 
Hiroshima
 
and
 
Nagasaki,
 
the
 
world
 
raced
 
to
 
come
 
together
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
body,
 
to
 
prevent
 
such
 
things
 
from
 
happening
 
again.
 
 
The
 
need
 
for
 
nations
 
to
 
unite
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
forum
 
has
 
never
 
been
 
more
 
pressing.

2.
 
MULTILATERALISM
 
IS
 
THE
 
SOLUTION
 
 
This
 
multilateral
 
effort
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
cure-all.
 
Wherever
 
humans
 
live,
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
conflict.
 
 
But
 
today’s
 
crises
 
are
 
far
 
more
 
complex,
 
and
 
seemingly
 
more
 
intractable
 
and
 
even
 
more
 
dangerous
 
than
 
80
 
years
 
ago.
 
 
The
 
atomic
 
weapons
 
of
 
the
 
1940s
 
have
 
proliferated
 
into
 
the
 
nuclear
 
weapons
 
of
 
today,
 
able
 
to
 
wipe
 
out
 
all
 
human
 
life
 
many
 
times
 
over.
 
7
 
 
Diseases
 
now
 
cross
 
oceans
 
in
 
a
 
day,
 
potentially
 
leading
 
to
 
pandemics
 
that
 
can
 
last
 
for
 
years.
 
 
Cyberattacks
 
can
 
leap
 
borders
 
in
 
a
 
second.
 
 
Financial
 
contagion
 
can
 
cripple
 
economies
 
in
 
an
 
instant.
 
 
And
 
climate
 
change,
 
-
 
yes,
 
climate
 
change
 
-
 
whose
 
storms
 
and
 
rising
 
seas
 
and
 
fires
 
and
 
8
 
floods
 
make
 
no
 
distinction
 
between
 
rich
 
or
 
poor,
 
strong
 
or
 
weak,
 
can
 
devastate
 
us
 
all.
 
 
No
 
single
 
nation,
 
acting
 
on
 
its
 
own,
 
can
 
resolve
 
these.
 
 
Multilateral
 
approaches
 
are
 
not
 
the
 
problem.
 
Multilateral
 
approaches
 
offer
 
pathways
 
to
 
the
 
solutions.
 
 
The
 
United
 
Nations
 
is
 
not
 
perfect,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
tool
 
for
 
multilateral
 
action
 
that
 
we
 
have.
 
9
 
We
 
workmen
 
should
 
not
 
blame
 
our
 
tools.
 
The
 
flaw
 
is
 
not
 
in
 
the
 
hammer,
 
but
 
in
 
the
 
hand
 
that
 
lets
 
it
 
fall.
 
 
Your
 
Excellencies:
 
 
The
 
Commonwealth
 
of
 
The
 
Bahamas
 
is
 
committed
 
to
 
work
 
with
 
Members
 
to
 
find
 
solutions.
 
It
 
is
 
why
 
we
 
have
 
offered
 
ourselves
 
as
 
a
 
candidate
 
for
 
a
 
non-permanent
 
seat
 
on
 
the
 
Security
 
Council
 
for
 
the
 
2032-2033
 
term.
 
 
10
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
candidacy
 
just
 
for
 
ourselves.
 
It
 
is
 
for
 
every
 
small
 
state
 
that
 
not
 
only
 
insists
 
that
 
its
 
voice
 
must
 
count,
 
but
 
also
 
knows
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
much
 
to
 
contribute
 
in
 
matters
 
of
 
global
 
peace.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
we
 
cannot
 
turn
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
agony
 
of
 
the
 
Middle
 
East.
 
The
 
aspirations
 
of
 
the
 
Palestinian
 
people
 
for
 
dignity
 
and
 
self-determination
 
are
 
real.
 
Along
 
with
 
the
 
state
 
of
 
Israel,
 
both
 
peoples
 
have
 
a
 
right
 
to
 
security,
 
sovereignty,
 
and
 
peace.
 
11
 
For
 
generations,
 
this
 
conflict
 
has
 
tested
 
the
 
conscience
 
of
 
the
 
world.
 
But
 
resignation
 
is
 
not
 
an
 
option.
 
The
 
vision
 
of
 
two
 
states,
 
living
 
side
 
by
 
side
 
in
 
peace
 
and
 
mutual
 
recognition,
 
remains
 
the
 
only
 
pathway
 
to
 
justice,
 
stability,
 
and
 
reconciliation.
 
We
 
must
 
not
 
abandon
 
dialogue
 
for
 
despair.
 
 
The
 
multilateral
 
capabilities
 
and
 
capacity
 
of
 
the
 
UN
 
should
 
be
 
front
 
and
 
centre
 
of
 
this
 
effort.
 
 
12
 
If
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
the
 
organisation
 
has
 
structural
 
and
 
institutional
 
weaknesses,
 
then
 
let’s
 
fix
 
them.
 
 
If
 
we
 
think
 
that
 
standards
 
are
 
not
 
evenly
 
applied,
 
that
 
powerful
 
states
 
avoid
 
consequences
 
for
 
aggression
 
or
 
human
 
rights
 
abuses,
 
while
 
weaker
 
states
 
are
 
sanctioned
 
more
 
readily,
 
then
 
let’s
 
step
 
up
 
and
 
fix
 
them.
 
 
The
 
UN
 
is
 
only
 
the
 
sum
 
of
 
its
 
parts.
 
13
 
Any
 
lack
 
of
 
effectiveness,
 
any
 
lack
 
of
 
practical
 
impact,
 
lies
 
squarely
 
at
 
the
 
feet
 
of
 
Member
 
States.
 
The
 
solution
 
is
 
not
 
to
 
abandon
 
it,
 
but
 
to
 
fix
 
it.
 
 
3.
 
FOR
 
THE
 
BAHAMAS:
 
THE
 
CHALLENGES
 
AND
 
CRISES
 
FACING
 
OUR
 
COUNTRY
 
ARE
 
EXTERNAL
 
 
For
 
countries
 
like
 
The
 
Bahamas,
 
the
 
biggest
 
challenges
 
and
 
crises
 
we
 
face
 
are
 
not
 
of
 
our
 
making.
 
14
 
 
And
 
yet
 
we
 
are
 
the
 
ones
 
who
 
feel
 
the
 
impacts
 
the
 
most.
 
 
Our
 
independent
 
Bahamas
 
has
 
never
 
fought
 
a
 
war:
 
and
 
yet
 
conflicts
 
in
 
faraway
 
places
 
cause
 
severe
 
economic
 
shocks,
 
with
 
Bahamians
 
forced
 
to
 
pay
 
higher
 
prices
 
and
 
suffer
 
from
 
unreliable
 
supply
 
chains.
 
 
15
 
Above
 
all,
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
physical
 
changes
 
relating
 
to
 
climate,
 
that
 
are
 
causing
 
crises
 
which
 
are
 
critical,
 
urgent
 
and
 
existential.
 
 
Over
 
the
 
past
 
few
 
years,
 
many
 
Bahamian
 
voices
 
have
 
raised
 
the
 
alarm
 
in
 
many
 
international
 
forums,
 
about
 
the
 
risks
 
we
 
face
 
from
 
threats
 
of
 
climate
 
change.
 
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
luxury
 
of
 
re-starting
 
an
 
esoteric
 
conversation
 
about
 
the
 
causes
 
of
 
climate
 
change.
 
16
 
Our
 
living
 
reality
 
means
 
that
 
we
 
simply
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
time.
 
 
As
 
I
 
speak
 
to
 
you
 
today,
 
right
 
now,
 
right
 
now
 
a
 
Tropical
 
Storm
 
is
 
moving
 
up
 
our
 
chain
 
of
 
islands.
 
 
We
 
hope.
 
We
 
pray
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
lucky.
 
But
 
can
 
we
 
remain
 
lucky
 
every
 
season?
 
Every
 
single
 
year?
 
 
17
 
We
 
know
 
what
 
we
 
need
 
to
 
do.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
adapt
 
and
 
to
 
make
 
ourselves
 
more
 
resilient.
 
But
 
even
 
with
 
the
 
best
 
intentions,
 
a
 
Small
 
Island
 
State
 
like
 
ours,
 
with
 
a
 
population
 
of
 
around
 
400,000
 
people
 
and
 
an
 
economy
 
of
 
approximately
 
$12
 
billion,
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
the
 
resources.
 
 
We
 
have
 
the
 
cleanest
 
air
 
in
 
the
 
world,
 
and
 
emit
 
far
 
less
 
than
 
1%
 
of
 
carbon
 
generated
 
by
 
human
 
18
 
activity,
 
so
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
others
 
to
 
also
 
adapt.
 
 
Is
 
it
 
really
 
too
 
much
 
to
 
ask
 
of
 
those
 
most
 
responsible,
 
to
 
change
 
their
 
behaviour
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
us
 
might
 
have
 
a
 
better
 
chance
 
at
 
survival?
 
 
Along
 
with
 
climate
 
change,
 
our
 
closest
 
neighbours
 
also
 
suffer
 
from
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
external
 
threats.
 
 
19
 
Our
 
neighbours
 
in
 
Cuba
 
have
 
suffered
 
for
 
decades
 
under
 
an
 
embargo
 
which
 
has
 
caused
 
suffering
 
without
 
delivering
 
justice.
 
The
 
embargo
 
has
 
punished
 
ordinary
 
people
 
without
 
changing
 
policy.
 
Friends:
 
Engagement,
 
not
 
isolation,
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
path
 
forward.
 
And
 
so,
 
The
 
Bahamas
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
add
 
its
 
voice
 
to
 
the
 
many
 
who
 
say:
 
 
“The
 
time
 
has
 
come.
 
 
Lift
 
the
 
embargo”.
 
 
20
 
And
 
what
 
of
 
Haiti?
 
Too
 
often
 
the
 
suffering
 
of
 
its
 
people
 
has
 
been
 
met
 
with
 
indifference.
 
The
 
Multinational
 
Security
 
Support
 
Mission,
 
under
 
Kenyan
 
leadership,
 
has
 
been
 
an
 
important
 
bridge.
 
But
 
bridges
 
must
 
be
 
a
 
pathway
 
to
 
the
 
solution.
 
That
 
mission
 
must
 
evolve
 
into
 
a
 
force
 
strong
 
enough
 
to
 
meet
 
the
 
still-present
 
threat
 
of
 
violence
 
and
 
lawlessness.
 
 
But
 
Haiti
 
needs
 
more
 
than
 
security.
 
21
 
It
 
needs
 
investment,
 
partnership,
 
and
 
hope.
 
 
The
 
lack
 
of
 
security
 
in
 
Haiti
 
disproportionately,
 
adversely
 
impacts
 
the
 
security
 
of
 
The
 
Bahamas.
 
And
 
we
 
can
 
no
 
longer
 
continue
 
to
 
carry
 
so
 
much
 
of
 
the
 
burden
 
and
 
plight
 
of
 
the
 
Haitian
 
people.
 
 
The
 
world
 
must
 
act.
 
We
 
say
 
this
 
not
 
out
 
of
 
fatigue,
 
but
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
conscious
 
realization
 
that
 
a
 
crisis
 
of
 
this
 
magnitude
 
cannot
 
be
 
left
 
to
 
neighbours
 
alone.
 
22
 
It
 
requires
 
a
 
global
 
response.
 
The
 
Bahamas
 
therefore
 
calls
 
for
 
a
 
dedicated
 
United
 
Nations
 
Support
 
Office
 
for
 
Haiti:
 
an
 
institution
 
to
 
coordinate
 
aid,
 
sustain
 
international
 
attention,
 
strengthen
 
institutions,
 
and
 
nurture
 
democracy.
 
 
We
 
cannot
 
claim
 
fidelity
 
to
 
peace,
 
and
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
ignore
 
Haiti.
 
 
 
 
23

THE
 
DYSTOPIAN
 
ALTERNATIVE
 
Your
 
Excellencies:
 
 
The
 
lessons
 
of
 
history
 
are
 
clear.
 
To
 
retreat
 
into
 
a
 
world
 
of
 
i-so-la-tionist
 
protectionism,
 
where
 
might
 
is
 
right,
 
and
 
the
 
resources
 
of
 
the
 
planet
 
are
 
plundered
 
for
 
the
 
few,
 
is
 
to
 
return
 
to
 
a
 
time
 
when
 
life
 
was
 
famously
 
described
 
as
 
“nasty,
 
brutish
 
and
 
short”
1
.

‘Leviathan’,
 
by
 
Thomas
 
Hobbes
 
(1651)
 
24
 
There
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
fairly
 
swift
 
breakdown
 
in
 
international
 
peace
 
and
 
security.
 
 
With
 
no
 
global
 
forum
 
for
 
conflict
 
mediation,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
likelihood
 
that
 
disputes
 
would
 
more
 
often
 
escalate
 
into
 
wars,
 
border
 
clashes
 
and
 
proxy
 
conflicts.
 
 
With
 
every
 
country
 
facing
 
increasingly
 
dangerous
 
and
 
rapid
 
climate
 
change,
 
the
 
collective
 
action
 
needed
 
to
 
address
 
it,
 
would
 
likely
 
hasten
 
climate
 
breakdown.
 
 
25
 
The
 
kind
 
of
 
economic
 
fragmentation
 
that
 
heralded
 
the
 
Great
 
Depression
 
in
 
America
 
in
 
the
 
1930s
 
would
 
re-emerge.
 
 
 
Protectionist
 
sanctions
 
and
 
trade
 
barriers,
 
the
 
collapse
 
of
 
supply
 
chains
 
and
 
the
 
resulting
 
higher
 
costs
 
of
 
living
 
around
 
the
 
world,
 
would
 
recreate
 
the
 
same
 
conditions
 
that
 
fuelled
 
the
 
rise
 
of
 
fascism,
 
and
 
the
 
explosion
 
of
 
the
 
Second
 
World
 
War.
 
 
Is
 
this
 
what
 
we
 
really
 
want?
 
26
 
No
 
matter
 
how
 
imperfect,
 
are
 
we
 
really
 
prepared
 
to
 
throw
 
away
 
what
 
we
 
have?
 
 
5.
 
ENLIGHTENED
 
SELF-INTEREST
 
 
Your
 
Excellencies:
 
We
 
recognise
 
that
 
we
 
seem
 
to
 
live
 
in
 
a
 
time
 
when
 
the
 
global
 
community
 
appears
 
indifferent
 
to
 
the
 
suffering
 
and
 
deaths
 
of
 
millions
 
of
 
our
 
fellow
 
human
 
beings.
 
 
27
 
And
 
yet,
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
potential
 
climate
 
disaster,
 
today
 
we
 
ask
 
not
 
for
 
your
 
pity.
 
We
 
do
 
not
 
ask
 
for
 
charity.
 
We
 
ask
 
simply
 
that
 
you
 
act
 
in
 
your
 
own,
 
enlightened
 
self-interest.
 
The
 
security
 
and
 
prosperity
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
us
 
in
 
the
 
region,
 
the
 
hemisphere,
 
and
 
the
 
world
 
are
 
interconnected.
 
 
Even
 
if
 
we
 
do
 
not
 
agree
 
on
 
the
 
causes,
 
as
 
I
 
have
 
previously
 
said
 
to
 
this
 
Assembly,
 
our
 
lived
 
28
 
reality
 
is
 
that
 
our
 
storms
 
and
 
hurricanes
 
are
 
your
 
fires
 
and
 
floods.
 
 
If
 
The
 
Bahamas
 
were
 
to
 
collapse
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
disproportionate
 
risks
 
we
 
face
 
from
 
climate
 
change,
 
economic
 
vulnerabilities
 
and
 
external
 
geopolitical
 
pressures,
 
the
 
world
 
would
 
lose
 
more
 
than
 
the
 
best
 
tourist
 
destination
 
on
 
the
 
planet.
 
 
We
 
ask
 
for
 
nothing
 
more
 
than
 
what
 
we
 
all
 
want.
 
29
 
The
 
right
 
to
 
live
 
in
 
peace
 
and
 
security
 
and
 
in
 
pursuit
 
of
 
happiness.
 
But
 
most
 
of
 
all,
 
just
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
live.
 
 
Thank
 
you.
