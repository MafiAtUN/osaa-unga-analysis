Madam
 
President,
 
Excellencies,
 
Distinguished
 
ladies
 
and
 
gentlemen,
 
The
 
twenty-first
 
century
 
has
 
been
 
marked
 
by
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
crises
 
for
 
which
 
the
 
world
 
was
 
unprepared.
 
A
 
financial
 
crisis
 
that
 
started
 
in
 
2008
 
which
 
then
 
triggered
 
fiscal
 
crises
 
across
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
world’s
 
countries.
 
 
And
 
if
 
that
 
was
 
not
 
enough,
 
a
 
social
 
crisis
 
characterised
 
by
 
rising
 
inequality
 
with
 
the
 
consequences
 
thereto
 
-
 
be
 
it
 
substance
 
abuse,
 
mental
 
health
 
challenges,
 
homelessness
 
or
 
human
 
trafficking.
 
 
1
 
 
And
 
if
 
that
 
was
 
not
 
enough,
 
a
 
global
 
pandemic
 
lasting
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
years
 
that
 
took
 
the
 
lives
 
of
 
millions
 
of
 
people
 
and
 
for
 
those
 
surviving,
 
restricted
 
choice
 
and
 
movement
 
for
 
them.
 
All
 
of
 
this
 
has
 
been
 
exacerbated
 
by
 
the
 
spreading
 
of
 
fake
 
news.
 
This
 
distorts
 
reality
 
and
 
threatens
 
the
 
stability
 
of
 
our
 
societies,
 
creating
 
a
 
platform
 
for
 
hate
 
to
 
thrive
 
and
 
prejudice
 
to
 
rise.
 
 
But,
 
deeper
 
than
 
all
 
these
 
crises
 
is
 
a
 
bigger
 
more
 
insidious
 
crisis
 
that
 
is
 
undermining
 
our
 
domestic
 
and
 
global
 
institutions
 
that
 
have
 
promoted
 
order,
 
peace
 
and
 
prosperity:
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
crisis
 
of
 
TRUTH.
 
Excellencies,
 
when
 
we
 
lose
 
shared
 
TRUTH,
 
our
 
countries
 
and
 
our
 
global
 
society
 
loses
 
its
 
center
 
of
 
gravity.
 
At
 
first,
 
the
 
damage
 
may
 
seem
 
quiet.
 
Words
 
bend
 
and
 
facts
 
drift
 
in
 
the
 
service
 
of
 
political
 
point-scoring.
 
But,
 
slowly,
 
over
 
time,
 
we
 
descend
 
into
 
political
 
tribalism.
 
We
 
develop
 
alternative
 
realities.
 
And,
 
we
 
are
 
unable
 
to
 
understand
 
each
 
other
 
and
 
communicate
 
with
 
each
 
other
 
because
 
we
 
lack
 
a
 
center.
 
Then,
 
we
 
grow
 
suspicious
 
of
 
each
 
other.
 
In
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
truth,
 
TRUST
 
deteriorates.
 
2
 
 
You
 
see
 
it
 
all
 
around
 
us.
 
In
 
global
 
forums
 
and
 
on
 
the
 
block
 
in
 
communities
 
in
 
your
 
own
 
countries.
 
 
Trust
 
between
 
neighbours.
 
Trust
 
between
 
the
 
governed
 
and
 
the
 
governing.
 
Trust
 
in
 
our
 
instructions.
 
Trust
 
in
 
our
 
social
 
order.
 
Trust
 
in
 
our
 
health
 
systems.
 
Trust
 
in
 
our
 
global
 
rules
 
governance
 
structures.
 
 
It
 
all
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
falling
 
apart.
 
When
 
we
 
lack
 
truth
 
and
 
we
 
lack
 
trust,
 
law
 
becomes
 
theater,
 
news
 
becomes
 
spectacle
 
and
 
science
 
becomes
 
just
 
another
 
opinion.
 
As
 
I
 
have
 
had
 
cause
 
to
 
say
 
in
 
this
 
Great
 
Hall
 
a
 
few
 
times,
 
our
 
world
 
today
 
worryingly
 
resembles
 
the
 
world
 
of
 
100
 
years
 
ago.
 
And
 
this
 
has
 
become
 
even
 
more
 
evident
 
with
 
the
 
closing
 
of
 
our
 
borders
 
to
 
both
 
goods
 
and
 
people.
 
 
This
 
has
 
magnified
 
the
 
geopolitical
 
tensions
 
which
 
had
 
already
 
taken
 
root.
 
Disturbingly
 
war
 
only
 
entered
 
the
 
daily
 
lexicon
 
of
 
the
 
West
 
not
 
when
 
thousands
 
were
 
dying
 
on
 
the
 
continent
 
of
 
Africa
 
or
 
in
 
Myanmar
 
but
 
when
 
war
 
became
 
a
 
reality
 
in
 
Ukraine.
 
Nevertheless,
 
we
 
call
 
for
 
peace
 
in
 
Ukraine.
 
3
 
 
Only
 
yesterday
 
a
 
leading
 
British
 
Newspaper
 
reminded
 
us
 
that
 
for
 
500
 
days
 
260,000
 
people
 
virtually
 
the
 
population
 
of
 
my
 
country
 
people
 
have
 
been
 
trapped
 
in
 
the
 
Sudanese
 
city
 
of
 
El
 
Fasher.
 
They
 
reported
 
while
 
political
 
progress
 
stalls,
  
those
 
who
 
attempt
 
escape
 
are
 
killed
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
remain
 
inside
 
are
 
starved.
 
The
 
world
 
must
 
not
 
ignore
 
the
 
horror
  
in
 
Sudan
 
and
 
definitely
 
not
 
Gaza.
 
The
 
genocidal
 
destruction
 
taking
 
place
 
in
 
Gaza
 
right
 
now
 
no
 
attention.
 
Yes
 
there
 
must
 
be
 
a
 
release
 
of
 
the
 
hostages
 
taken
 
on
 
October
 
7th.
 
 
But
 
we
 
have
 
now
 
gone
 
to
 
a
 
point
 
where
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
human
 
sensibilities
 
are
 
offended
 
by
 
the
 
continuous
 
and
 
disproportionate
 
attacks
 
on
 
the
 
Palestinian
 
people
 
and
 
the
 
failure
 
to
 
allow
 
access
 
by
 
the
 
international
 
community
 
to
 
the
 
survivors
 
for
 
the
 
provision
 
of
 
humanitarian
 
aid.
 
The
 
survivors
 
are
 
entitled
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
words
 
of
 
Bob
 
Marley
 
-
 
 
“How
 
can
 
you
 
be
 
sitting
 
there
 
telling
 
me
 
that
 
you
 
care?
 
When
 
every
 
time
 
I
 
look
 
around
 
the
 
people
 
suffer
 
in
 
the
 
suffering
 
in
 
every
 
way,
 
in
 
everywhere.”
 
 
4
 
 
It
 
calls
 
to
 
mind
 
the
 
Roman
 
historian,
 
Tacitus
 
who
 
quoted
 
a
 
Scottish
 
chief
 
team
 
fighting
 
against
 
the
 
military
 
mate
 
of
 
the
 
Roman
 
empire.
 
A
 
mention
 
only
 
the
 
last
 
two
 
sentences.
 
“They
 
plunder,
 
they
 
butcher,
 
their
 
ravish…
 
they
 
make
 
it
 
desert
 
and
 
call
 
it
 
‘peace’.”
 
They
 
make
 
a
 
desert
 
and
 
they
 
call
 
it
 
peace.
 
The
 
real
 
tragedy
 
of
 
war
 
is
 
that
 
these
 
children,
 
when
 
they
 
become
 
grandparents
 
will
 
still
 
be
 
answering
 
the
 
innocent
 
questions
 
posed
 
by
 
their
 
grandchildren
 
as
 
to
 
how
 
they
 
lost
 
their
 
limbs.
 
“Granny,
 
how
 
did
 
you
 
lose
 
your
 
leg?”
 
 
And
 
when
 
they
 
answer,
 
we
 
run
 
the
 
risk
 
that
 
the
 
violence
 
and
 
hate
 
will
 
be
 
perpetuated
 
for
 
another
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
generations.
 
This
 
is
 
NOT
 
good.
 
Madame
 
President,
 
it
 
is
 
happening
 
now
 
on
 
our
 
watch.
 
 
We
 
can
  
and
 
must
 
do
 
better
 
to
 
secure
 
the
 
peace
 
-
 
in
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
children.
 
5
 
 
At
 
the
 
very
 
least
 
the
 
international
 
community
 
must
 
immediately
 
find
 
the
 
funding
 
to
 
support
 
the
 
children
 
of
 
Gaza
 
and
 
the
 
children
 
of
 
Sudan
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
three
 
months.
 
In
 
Gaza
 
it
 
is
 
$66
 
million
 
that
 
is
 
needed
 
and
 
$200
 
million
 
for
 
Sudan.
 
This
 
money
 
is
 
mostly
 
nutrition
 
related,
 
to
 
reverse
 
or
 
mitigate
 
famine
 
and
 
also
 
to
 
provide
 
water
 
and
 
sanitation
 
and
 
health
 
interventions.
 
We
 
should
 
note
 
that
 
there
 
have
 
been
 
multiple
 
disease
 
outbreaks,
 
including
 
cholera.
 
So
 
Madam
 
president,
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
clear
 
as
 
I
 
move
 
on,
 
a
 
lasting
 
peace
 
can
 
never
 
be
 
achieved
 
through
 
violence;
 
it
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
achieved
 
through
 
justice
 
and
 
dialogue
 
-
 
talking.
 
And
 
lest
 
we
 
forget,
  
where
 
others
 
are
 
seeking
 
to
 
build
 
the
 
peace
 
and
 
preserve
 
humanity
 
in
 
Gaza,
 
the
 
international
 
community
 
must
 
not
 
condone
 
the
 
bombing
 
of
 
those
 
states
 
who
 
look
 
to
 
facilitate
 
peace.
 
 
It
 
is
 
clear
 
-
 
yes
 
-
 
Mme
 
President
 
that
 
the
 
world
 
is
 
still
 
in
 
need
 
of
 
a
 
reset.
 
We
 
must
 
first
 
and
 
foremost
 
decide
 
whether
 
we
 
still
 
agree
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
set
 
of
 
values
 
that
 
inform
 
the
 
Charter.
 
As
 
simple
 
as
 
it
 
seems,
 
this
 
is
 
a
 
necessary
 
step
 
in
 
any
 
reset.
 
For
 
values
 
have
 
changed
 
in
 
many
 
of
 
6
 
 
our
 
countries
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
80
 
years.
 
We
 
cannot
 
assume
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
business
 
as
 
usual.
 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
our
 
inability
 
to
 
bring
 
about
 
peace
 
in
 
multiple
 
conflicts,
 
there
 
continues
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
issues
 
that
 
threaten
 
our
 
way
 
of
 
life
 
and
 
the
 
stability
 
of
 
our
 
planet:
 
●
 
The
 
climate
 
crisis;
 
●
 
Food
 
insecurity,
 
water
 
scarcity;
 
●
 
Mass
 
flows
 
of
 
refugees
 
and
 
displaced
 
persons;
 
●
 
Poverty
 
and
 
increasing
 
inequality
 
within
 
and
 
between
 
societies;
 
and
 
of
 
course
 
●
 
Unregulated
 
AI.
 
Many
 
of
 
our
 
people
 
ask
 
everyday,
 
why
 
has
 
the
 
U.N
 
not
 
done
 
better.
 
 
The
 
simple
 
truth
 
is,
 
that
 
countries
 
have
 
lacked
 
the
 
political
 
will
 
to
 
live
 
by
 
the
 
Charter
 
and
 
do
 
what
 
is
 
right
 
for
 
humanity.
 
 
Countries
 
of
 
different
 
sizes,
 
capacities
 
and
 
cultures
 
can
 
only
 
survive
 
in
 
the
 
world
 
in
 
which
 
we
 
live
 
if
 
we
 
maintain
 
a
 
rules-based
 
system.
 
 
7
 
 
It
 
is
 
no
 
different
 
to
 
what
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
maintain
 
to
 
protect
 
the
 
vulnerable
 
and
 
the
 
weak.
 
This
 
is
 
what
 
protects
 
us
 
from
 
bullying
 
and
 
rogue
 
behavior.
 
Our
 
Charter
 
was
 
designed
 
to
 
promote
 
compassion,
 
equality,
 
and
 
fairness,
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
why
 
it
 
is
 
imperative
 
that
 
we
 
maintain
 
the
 
rules-based
 
system.
 
I
 
speak
 
as
 
a
 
leader
 
of
 
a
 
small
 
country,
 
our
 
future
 
is
 
placed
 
at
 
risk
 
unless
 
we
 
preserve
 
this
 
rules-based
 
system.
 
The
 
law
 
of
 
the
 
jungle
 
does
 
not
 
guarantee
 
any
 
of
 
us
 
a
 
future
 
or
 
a
 
livable
 
planet.
 
 
If
 
this
 
institution
 
matters,
 
we
 
must
 
simply
 
step
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
plate.
 
Unlike
 
the
 
Western
 
news
 
Federation,
 
when
 
one
 
country
 
left
 
and
 
one
 
from
 
10
 
became
 
zero-
 
we
 
must
 
remember
 
that
 
they
 
want
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
countries
 
leave
 
193,
 
the
 
sum
 
of
 
what
 
remains
 
does
 
NOT
 
equal
 
0.
 
Those
 
who
 
remain
 
can
 
continue
 
to
 
pursue
 
our
 
vital
 
interest
 
-
 
what
 
will
 
strengthen
 
us
 
to
 
build
 
peace
 
or
 
to
 
better
 
face
 
challenges
 
from
 
climate
 
to
 
pandemics
 
to
 
unregulated
 
AI
 
and
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
better
 
life
 
for
 
our
 
people.
 
8
 
 
There
 
is
 
no
 
doubt
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
case
 
for
 
efficiency
 
gains
 
to
 
be
 
made
 
in
 
the
 
U.N’s
 
institutional
 
framework.
 
But
 
once
 
that
 
is
 
completed,
 
Member
 
states
 
who
 
want
 
or
 
need
 
a
 
rules
 
based
 
order
 
must
 
put
 
their
 
money
 
where
 
their
 
mouth
 
is.
 
 
If
 
we
 
are
 
to
 
be
 
protected
 
by
 
a
 
rules-based
 
system,
 
then
 
we
 
must
 
step
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
plate
 
and
 
provide
 
the
 
funds
 
to
 
bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
to
 
deliver
 
the
 
results
 
that
 
we
 
desire.
 
It
 
is
 
as
 
simple
 
as
 
that.
 
 
And
 
believe
 
you
 
me,
 
the
 
arithmetic
 
is
 
not
 
that
 
bad.
 
It
 
is
 
within
 
each
 
of
 
our
 
reach.
 
And
 
we
 
do
 
remember
 
the
 
very
 
clear
 
principle
 
-
 
Equality
 
among
 
equals,
 
proportionality
 
among
 
unequals.
 
And
 
let
 
us
 
remember,
 
while
 
the
 
world
 
confronts
 
these
 
multiple
 
crises
 
there
 
are
 
still
 
some
 
things
 
that
 
have
 
worked
 
for
 
the
 
benefit
 
of
 
our
 
people.
  
 
We
 
have
 
adopted
 
a
 
historic
 
Pandemic
 
Agreement
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
world
 
more
 
equitable
 
and
 
safer
 
from
 
future
 
pandemics.
 
A
 
full
 
appreciation
 
of
 
this
 
treaty
 
will
 
only
 
come
 
when
 
the
 
next
 
pandemic
 
hits
 
us.
 
 
We
 
have
 
agreed
 
to
 
the
 
Seville
 
Commitment
 
which
 
seeks
 
to
 
fulfil
 
the
 
promise
 
of
 
the
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goals;
 
and
 
which
 
has
 
9
 
 
mainstreamed
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
financing
 
concepts
 
that
 
were
 
simply
 
not
 
taken
 
into
 
account
 
a
 
decade
 
ago,
 
from
 
debt
 
swaps
 
to
 
natural
 
disaster
 
clauses.
 
We
 
need
 
to
 
claim
 
it
 
too
 
as
 
was
 
advocated
 
by
 
the
 
Bridgetown
 
Initiative.
  
 
We
 
have
 
committed
 
to
 
ambitious
 
global
 
action
 
to
 
combat
 
Anti-Microbial
 
Resistance.
 
I
 
have
 
said
 
repeatedly
 
that
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
silent,
 
slow
 
motion
 
pandemic
 
that
 
threatens
 
to
 
reverse
 
a
 
century
 
of
 
medical
 
progress.
 
 
Earlier
 
this
 
week
 
we
 
successfully
 
brought
 
into
 
force
 
the
 
Beyond
 
Boundaries
 
and
 
National
 
Jurisdiction
 
treaty.
  
As
 
a
 
large
 
ocean
 
state,
 
I’m
 
acutely
 
aware
 
of
 
the
 
critical
 
importance
 
to
 
protect
 
our
 
oceans
 
and
 
it’s
 
marine
 
biodiversity
 
as
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
ecological
 
balance
 
of
 
the
 
planet.
 
We
 
have
 
adopted
 
the
 
ambitious
 
Pact
 
for
 
the
 
Future,
 
which
 
provides
 
a
 
roadmap
 
-
 
a
 
North
 
Star
 
-
 
for
 
our
 
work
 
to
 
protect
 
the
  
and
 
planet
 
of
  
our
 
future.
 
 
10
 
 
The
 
two
 
instruments
 
identified
 
by
 
our
 
Secretary-General
 
for
 
regulating
 
AI
 
must
 
now
 
be
 
our
 
priority
 
if
 
we
 
are
 
to
 
avoid
 
severe
 
deepening
 
inequality
 
and
 
leaving
 
our
 
people
 
exposed
 
to
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
exploitation
 
and
 
the
 
distortion
 
of
 
facts.
 
I
 
must
 
say
 
that
 
Regrettably,
 
I
 
have
 
experienced
 
on
 
a
 
well-known
 
commercial
 
AI
 
platform
 
examples
 
of
 
censorship
 
that
 
seek
 
to
 
deny
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
details
 
of
 
our
 
history
 
in
 
this
 
hemisphere
 
-
 
both
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
Barbados
 
Slave
 
Code
 
and
 
the
 
South
 
Carolina
 
Slave
 
Code.
 
Speaking
 
as
 
a
 
small
 
country,
 
I
 
see
 
no
 
future
 
for
 
myself
 
and
 
my
 
people
 
without
 
a
 
Rules-based
 
system.
 
 
Before
 
I
 
go
 
on,
 
let
 
me
 
recognise
 
the
 
outgoing
 
President
 
of
 
the
 
General
 
Assembly,
 
H.E.
 
Philemon
 
Yang
 
for
 
his
 
impactful
 
presidency.
 
Let
 
me
 
also
 
offer
 
my
 
heartfelt
 
congratulations
 
to
 
H.E.
 
Annalena
 
Baerbock
 
for
 
assuming
 
the
 
presidency.
 
 
Barbados
 
looks
 
forward
 
to
 
working
 
closely
 
with
 
you
 
as
 
you
 
execute
 
your
 
vision.
 
11
 
 
The
 
fact,
 
Madam
 
President,
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
only
 
the
 
fifth
 
woman
 
to
 
occupy
 
this
 
post
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
eighty
 
years
 
is
 
a
 
cause
 
both
 
for
 
profound
 
concern,
 
but
 
renewed
 
optimism.
 
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
testament
 
to
 
the
 
very
 
point
 
I
 
am
 
seeking
 
to
 
make.
 
This
  
organisation
 
is
 
working
 
-
  
but,
 
we
 
still
 
have
 
so,
 
so
 
much
 
to
 
do.
 
Madam
 
President,
 
On
 
climate
 
and
 
finance,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
real
 
danger
 
that
 
debates
 
in
 
this
 
great
 
chamber,
 
at
 
the
 
Conference
 
of
 
the
 
Parties
 
and
 
elsewhere,
 
risk
 
being
 
reduced
 
to
 
mere
 
performative
 
exercises.
 
 
We
 
have
 
watched
 
the
 
widely
 
celebrated
 
green
 
wave
 
which
 
swept
 
Europe
 
in
 
2019,
 
recede
 
and
 
in
 
its
 
backwash
 
that
 
continent
 
now
 
faces
 
deep
 
division
 
over
 
the
 
scale,
 
scope
 
and
 
speed
 
of
 
delivery
 
on
 
commitments
 
made
 
to
 
eliminate
 
climate
 
harming
 
pollution
 
by
 
2050.
 
Others
 
have
 
withdrawn
 
from
 
the
 
Paris
 
Agreement.
 
At
 
a
 
time,
 
Madam
 
President,
 
when
 
we
 
should
 
be
 
conducting
 
an
 
audit
 
of
 
the
 
achieved
 
targets
 
and
 
accomplished
 
deliverables,
 
we
 
continue,
 
for
 
the
 
most
 
part,
 
to
 
receive
 
IOU’s
 
and
 
statements
 
of
 
deferred
 
intent.
 
 
12
 
 
Even
 
as
 
we
 
have
 
witnessed
 
this
 
vacillation,
 
we
 
have
 
seen
 
a
 
re-dedication
 
to
 
breathing
 
new
 
life
 
into
 
high
 
carbon
 
and
 
high
 
polluting
 
forms
 
of
 
energy.
 
And,
 
we
 
have
 
also
 
witnessed
 
a
 
re-doubling
 
of
 
efforts
 
to
 
fund
 
military
 
build-ups,
 
even
 
at
 
the
 
expense
 
of
 
financing
 
our
 
way
 
to
 
sustainability
 
and
 
a
 
hospitable
 
planet.
  
 
Barbados
 
does
 
not
 
treat
 
climate
 
science
 
as
 
a
 
mere
 
conjecture.
 
And
 
neither
 
does
 
the
 
ICJ
 
nor
 
the
 
Inter-American
 
Court
 
of
 
Human
 
Rights.
 
Their
 
advisory
 
opinions
 
have
 
affirmed
 
the
 
legal
 
rights
 
and
 
entitlements
 
of
 
citizens
 
who
 
must,
 
on
 
a
 
daily
 
basis,
 
confront
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
climate
 
crisis.
  
 
In
 
this
 
regard,
 
we
 
especially
 
welcome
 
the
 
ICJ
 
ruling
 
to
 
the
 
effect
 
that
 
States
 
have
 
obligations
 
to
 
protect
 
the
 
climate
 
system
 
and
 
other
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
environment
 
from
 
emissions,
 
and
 
that
 
those
 
obligations
 
can
 
be
 
enforced
 
against
 
other
 
States.
 
 
Given
 
this
 
new
 
reality
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
ahead,
 
we
 
must
 
seize
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
find
 
COMMON
 
ground
 
on
 
the
 
question
 
of
 
the
 
climate
 
crisis.
 
 
13
 
 
I
 
propose
 
that
 
one
 
possible
 
way
 
forward
 
is
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
emissions
 
rather
 
than
 
the
 
fossil
 
fuel
 
industry.
 
As
 
I
 
have
 
said
 
before
 
the
 
fossil
 
fuel
 
industry
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
enemy
 
-it
 
is
 
the
 
emissions.
 
 
In
 
this
 
regard,
 
we
 
should
 
consider
 
working
 
towards
 
a
 
globally
 
legally
 
binding
 
framework
 
on
 
methane
 
which
 
could
 
contribute
 
to
 
reversing
 
global
 
temperature
 
rise
 
by
 
half
 
a
 
degree,
 
while
 
purchasing
 
time
 
to
 
scale
 
up
 
to
 
a
 
commercial
 
level,
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
decarbonising
 
technology.
  
 
The
 
Baku
 
to
 
Belém
 
Roadmap
 
must
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
necessary
 
resources—$1.3
 
trillion
 
annually
 
by
 
2035—are
 
not
 
only
 
committed.
  
But
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
political
 
will
 
and
 
ingenuity
 
of
 
countries
 
and
 
financial
 
institutions
 
that
 
will
  
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
sums
 
are
 
actually
 
delivered.
 
 
It
 
must
 
not
 
suffer
 
the
 
same
 
fate
 
as
 
the
 
Loss
 
and
 
Damage
 
Fund,
 
which
 
for
 
example,
 
despite
 
its
 
historic
 
establishment,
 
remains
 
grossly
 
under-capitalized,
 
with
 
less
 
than
 
$800
 
million
 
pledged
 
and
 
only
 
half
 
of
 
those
 
pledges
 
actually
 
materialized.
 
 
This
 
ambivalence
 
towards
 
finance
 
and
 
fiscal
 
space
 
is
 
what
 
gave
 
birth
 
to
 
the
 
Bridgetown
 
Initiative.
  
Its
 
latest
 
iteration
 
Bridgetown
 
3.0
 
will
 
shortly
 
be
 
reviewed
 
given
 
the
 
rapidly
 
changing
 
global
 
environment.
  
14
 
 
We
 
still
 
need
 
to
 
expand
 
liquidity
 
support
 
and
 
to
 
close
 
the
 
financing
 
gap
 
required
 
to
 
assist
 
vulnerable
 
countries
 
-
 
especially
 
the
 
V20
 
countries
 
-
 
in
 
building
 
their
 
resilience.
 
 
I
 
am
 
conscious
 
of
 
the
 
progress
 
by
 
which
 
multilateral
 
institutions
 
have
 
taken
 
onboard
 
some
 
of
 
our
 
arguments
 
in
 
the
 
BI,
 
especially
 
as
 
it
 
relates
 
to
 
climate
 
finance
 
and
 
to
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
vulnerability
 
-
 
debt
 
swaps
 
and
 
Climate
 
Resilient
 
Debt
 
Clauses
 
.
 
 
Madam
 
President,
 
All
 
of
 
these
 
goals
 
–
 
and
 
many
 
more
 
–
 
can
 
be
 
achieved
 
by
 
a
 
fully
 
functional
 
rules-based
 
system.
 
A
 
system
 
that
 
is
 
ambitious
 
in
 
its
 
goals,
 
effective
 
in
 
its
 
delivery
 
and
 
fair
 
in
 
its
 
organisation.
 
As
 
the
 
UN80
 
process
 
seeks
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
functioning
 
of
 
this
 
organisation,
 
we
 
must
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
initiatives
 
we
 
put
 
in
 
place
 
are
 
not
 
the
 
exclusive
 
outgrowth
 
of
 
budget
 
constraints
 
and
 
cost-cutting
 
exercises,
 
but
 
are
 
instead,
 
people-focused
 
and
 
delivery
 
driven,
 
providing
 
the
 
global
 
population
 
with
 
the
 
peace
 
and
 
security,
 
and
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
that
 
it
 
deserves
 
and
 
is
 
increasingly
 
demanding.
 
15
 
 
To
 
effect
 
this,
 
the
 
Security
 
Council
 
must
 
be
 
reformed.
 
It
 
must
 
reflect
 
the
 
multipolar
 
world
 
that
 
now
 
exists,
 
and
 
the
 
substantial
 
geopolitical
 
shifts
 
that
 
have
 
occurred
 
in
 
the
 
intervening
 
years
 
since
 
its
 
last
 
reform
 
in
 
1962.
 
 
Permanent
 
seats
 
for
 
Africa
 
and
 
a
 
seat
 
that
 
revolves
 
for
 
SIDS
 
are
 
an
 
essential
 
part
 
of
 
that
 
reform.
 
 
You
 
really
 
cannot
 
ask
 
us
 
to
 
show
 
up
 
for
 
family
 
photos
 
and
 
votes
 
when
 
you
 
need
 
them
 
and
 
then
 
exclude
 
us
 
from
 
the
 
family’s
 
decision
 
making
 
as
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
the
 
grown-ups
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
the
 
children.
 
We
 
are
 
not
 
minors
 
but
 
independent
 
sovereign
 
states
 
with
 
full
 
capacity
 
and
 
we
 
insist
 
on
 
being
 
treated
 
as
 
such.
 
 
Madam
 
President,
 
I
 
have
 
left
 
the
 
peace
 
and
 
security
 
situation
 
in
 
our
 
region,
 
the
 
Caribbean.
 
It
 
is
 
deeply
 
troubling.
 
 
For
 
example:
 
Haiti,
 
once
 
a
 
beacon
 
of
 
emancipation
 
and
 
revolution,
 
is
 
today
 
a
 
victim
 
of
 
centuries
 
of
 
external
 
interference
 
and
 
contemporary
 
internal
 
conflict.
 
 
16
 
 
We
 
thank
 
Kenya
 
for
 
its
 
extraordinary
 
leadership
 
of
 
the
 
Multinational
 
Security
 
Support
 
mission,
 
and
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
the
 
enhanced
 
support
 
of
 
the
 
UN
 
Security
 
Council
 
and
 
the
 
Organisation
 
of
 
the
 
American
 
States.
 
 
Haiti
 
requires
 
a
 
long
 
term
 
support
 
plan
 
addressing
 
security
 
and
 
development
 
needs.
 
With
 
the
 
requisite
 
political
 
will,
 
the
 
UN
 
Security
 
Council
 
and
 
the
 
international
 
development
 
system
 
are
 
well-equipped
 
to
 
deliver.
 
We
 
urge
 
dialogue
 
with
 
our
 
friends
 
and
 
partners
 
especially
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
on
 
the
 
inescapable
 
issue
 
of
 
the
 
flow
 
of
 
small
 
arms
 
and
 
light
 
weapons
 
not
 
only
 
into
 
Haiti,
 
but
 
across
 
this
 
hemisphere.
 
Fragile
 
economies
 
in
 
the
 
democracies
 
of
 
the
 
Caribbean
 
Community
 
are
 
now
 
being
 
threatened
 
by
 
this
 
incessant
 
flow
 
of
 
illegally
 
obtained
 
weapons
 
and
 
the
 
increasingly
 
organised
 
criminal
 
elements
 
which
 
utilise
 
them.
 
 
We
 
thank
 
Secretary
 
General
 
Guterres
 
for
 
his
 
unswerving
 
support
 
we
 
need
 
others
 
to
 
join
 
now
 
to
 
ensure
 
Haiti
 
can
 
turn
 
the
 
corner
 
and
 
prepare
 
itself
 
for
 
free
 
and
 
fair
 
democratic
 
elections.
 
 
Madam
 
President,
 
17
 
 
Cuba,
 
has
 
long
 
been
 
a
 
source
 
of
 
support
 
for
 
many
 
across
 
the
 
globe
 
in
 
times
 
of
 
conflict,
 
health
 
crisis
 
and
 
colonial
 
resistance.
 
Cuba
 
has
 
however,
 
paid
 
a
 
high
 
price
 
for
 
insisting
 
on
 
its
 
right
 
to
 
self-determination.
 
Again,
 
we
 
must
 
be
 
prepared
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
dialogue
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
stop
 
the
 
disproportionate
 
suffering
 
and
 
deprivation
 
being
 
inflicted
 
on
 
the
 
Cuban
 
society
 
by
 
what
 
is
 
now
 
globally
 
seen
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
unjust
 
embargo
 
and
 
other
 
unilateral
 
coercive
 
measures.
 
Barbados
 
reiterates
 
its
 
calls
 
for
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
embargo
 
and
 
removal
 
of
 
Cuba
 
from
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
State
 
Sponsors
 
of
 
Terrorism.
 
 
What
 
is
 
even
 
more
 
in
 
the
 
Caribbean
 
Sea,
 
we
 
are
 
witnessing
 
a
 
shocking
 
violation
 
of
 
a
 
hemispheric
 
understanding
 
that
 
the
 
Caribbean
 
be
 
treated
 
as
 
a
 
Zone
 
of
 
Peace.
 
 
There
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
build
 
up
 
in
 
military
 
assets
 
in
 
the
 
Caribbean
 
by
 
both
 
sides,
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
and
 
Venezuela.
 
We
 
believe
 
that
 
any
 
such
 
build
 
up
 
could
 
occasion
 
even
 
an
 
accident
 
can
 
put
 
the
 
Southern
 
Caribbean
 
at
 
disproportionate
 
risk.
 
It
 
is
 
not
 
acceptable
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
be
 
viewed
 
as
 
collateral
 
damage.
 
 
18
 
 
Full
 
respect
 
for
 
the
 
territorial
 
integrity
 
of
 
each,
 
and
 
every
 
state
 
in
 
the
 
Caribbean
 
must
 
be
 
respected.
 
Almost
 
all
 
wars
 
end
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
dialogue,
 
let
 
us
 
make
 
a
 
greater
 
effort
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
necessary
 
conversations
 
that
 
are
 
needed
 
to
 
prevent
 
war.
 
 
As
 
I
 
close
 
today,
 
I
 
leave
 
you
 
with
 
the
 
image
 
that
 
has
 
stayed
 
with
 
me
 
for
 
the
 
last
  
week
 
of
 
a
 
young
 
Palestinian
 
girl
 
of
 
six
 
or
 
seven
 
years
 
old,
 
walking
 
in
 
the
 
midst
 
of
 
the
 
rubble
 
in
 
Gaza.
 
Her
 
eyes
 
were
 
hollow
 
and
 
full
 
of
 
despair.
 
It
 
was
 
clear
 
that
 
she
 
was
 
in
 
great
 
pain.
 
She
 
carried
 
her
 
sister
 
on
 
her
 
shoulders,
 
clearly
 
recognizing
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
she
 
who
 
would
 
have
 
to
 
carry
 
the
 
burden
 
of
 
taking
 
them
 
to
 
safety.
 
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
ultimate
 
picture
 
of
 
hope
 
and
 
resilience.
 
 
Let
 
us
 
be
 
inspired
 
that
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
face
 
of
 
the
 
greatest
 
adversity
 
and
 
challenge,
 
we
 
can
 
rise.
 
If
 
a
 
six-year-old
 
can
 
push
 
past
 
all
 
the
 
physical
 
and
 
emotional
 
pain
 
and
 
still
 
find
 
hope
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
better
 
moment
 
ahead
 
of
 
her
 
then
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
duty
 
as
 
leaders
 
to
 
summon
 
that
 
spirit.
 
 
My
 
friends,
 
the
 
world
 
needs
 
it
 
now
 
more
 
than
 
ever.
 
It
 
is
 
not
 
beyond
 
us
 
to
 
forge
 
a
 
better
 
world
 
that
 
is
 
fair
 
and
 
just.
  
80
 
years
 
ago
 
a
 
few
 
19
 
 
countries
 
summoned
 
that
 
will.
 
Today
 
those
 
of
 
us
 
who
 
were
 
denied
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
be
 
heard
 
at
 
that
 
time
 
can
 
be
 
the
 
core
 
responders
 
to
 
this
 
critical
 
clarion
 
call.
 
Inspired
 
by
 
the
 
words
 
of
 
my
 
own
 
anthem,
 
upward
 
and
 
onwards,
 
we
 
shall
 
go,
 
Inspired
 
exulting
 
free
 
-
 
and
 
greater
 
will
 
our
 
WORLD
 
grow
 
in
 
strength
 
and
 
unity.
