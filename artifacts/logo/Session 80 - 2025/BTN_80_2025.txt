Madam
 
President,
 
Mr.
 
Secretary-General,
 
Excellencies,Distinguished
 
Delegates,
 
Kuzuzangpo!
 
I
 
bring
 
the
 
warm
 
greetings
 
of
 
His
 
Majesty
 
King
 
Jigme,
 
and
 
the
 
prayers
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
of
 
Bhutan
 
—
 
for
 
peace,
 
harmony,
 
and
 
progress
 
in
 
our
 
world.
 
Excellencies,
 
 
Eighty
 
years
 
ago,
 
from
 
the
 
devastation
 
of
 
the
 
Second
 
World
 
War,
 
the
 
founders
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
dared
 
to
 
imagine
 
a
 
world
 
at
 
peace.
 
They
 
chose
 
cooperation
 
over
 
conflict,
 
dialogue
 
over
 
division,
 
and
 
hope
 
over
 
despair.
 
They
 
built
 
an
 
institution
 
to
 
protect
 
humanity
 
from
 
its
 
worst
 
instincts
 
and
 
higher
 
risks.
 
Today,
 
our
 
challenges
 
are
 
different,
 
but
 
no
 
less
 
urgent:
 
a
 
planet
 
in
 
a
 
climate
 
crisis,
 
persistent
 
poverty,
 
and
 
conflicts
 
that
 
shatter
 
lives
 
and
 
erode
 
trust
 
among
 
nations.
 
The
 
Secretary-General’s
 
UN80
 
Initiative
 
calls
 
on
 
us
 
to
 
respond
 
with
 
renewed
 
purpose:
 
 
●
 
to
 
strengthen
 
the
 
UN’s
 
capacity
 
to
 
act
 
decisively
 
on
 
peace,
 
sustainable
 
development
 
and
 
climate
 
action;
 
 
●
 
to
 
restore
 
its
 
moral
 
authority;
 
 
●
 
and
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
fit
 
for
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
our
 
collective
 
future.
 
Bhutan
 
believes
 
in
 
a
 
United
 
Nations
 
that
 
is
 
representative,
 
responsive,
 
and
 
effective.
 
We
 
seek
 
a
 
multilateralism
 
that
 
delivers
 
results,
 
not
 
just
 
resolutions.
 
1
 
That
 
is
 
why
 
Bhutan
 
supports
 
reform
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
Nations,
 
including
 
reform
 
of
 
the
 
Security
 
Council
 
—
 
expanding
 
both
 
permanent
 
and
 
non-permanent
 
membership.
 
A
 
reformed
 
Council
 
must
 
include
 
deserving
 
nations
 
such
 
as
 
India
 
and
 
Japan
 
—
 
alongside
 
other
 
capable
 
and
 
leading
 
countries
 
to
 
reflect
 
today’s
 
complex
 
realities.
 
As
 
we
 
look
 
toward
 
the
 
UN
 
at
 
100,
 
let
 
us
 
commit
 
to
 
a
 
world
 
where
 
peace
 
is
 
the
 
norm,
 
where
 
climate
 
is
 
stable,
 
and
 
where
 
every
 
child
 
—
 
(no
 
matter
 
where
 
they
 
are
 
born)
 
-
 
has
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
grow
 
as
 
productive
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
global
 
community.
 
Bhutan
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
active
 
partner
 
on
 
this
 
journey:
 
●
 
speaking
 
for
 
the
 
small
 
and
 
vulnerable,
 
 
●
 
championing
 
sustainability
 
and
 
climate
 
action,
 
 
●
 
and
 
promoting
 
Gross
 
National
 
Happiness
 
as
 
an
 
alternate
 
measure
 
of
 
success
 
to
 
the
 
conventional
 
Gross
 
Domestic
 
Product.
 
Excellencies,
 
 
Reform
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
must
 
serve
 
a
 
purpose
 
beyond
 
itself.
 
It
 
must
 
equip
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
to
 
confront
 
the
 
defining
 
challenge
 
of
 
our
 
time
 
-
 
the
 
climate
 
crisis.
 
In
 
Bhutan,
 
we
 
have
 
endeavored
 
to
 
protect
 
our
 
forests,
 
keep
 
our
 
rivers
 
pristine,
 
and
 
take
 
pride
 
in
 
being
 
carbon-negative.
 
Each
 
year,
 
we
 
sequester
 
over
 
five
 
times
 
the
 
carbon
 
we
 
emit,
 
a
 
contribution
 
far
 
exceeding
 
our
 
size
 
and
 
resources.
 
Yet
 
we
 
are
 
already
 
confronting
 
the
 
harsh
 
realities
 
of
 
climate
 
change.
 
Our
 
mountains
 
are
 
warming
 
at
 
nearly
 
twice
 
the
 
global
 
average.
 
Centuries-old
 
glaciers
 
are
 
shrinking
 
at
 
alarming
 
rates.
 
Rivers
 
that
 
once
 
flowed
 
steadily,
 
now
 
swell
 
unpredictably,
 
into
 
destructive
 
floods
 
during
 
summer,
 
and
 
often
 
dry
 
in
 
winter.
 
This
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
distant
 
threat.
 
It
 
is
 
here!
 
It
 
is
 
now!
 
And
 
it
 
demands
 
urgent
 
action!
 
Every
 
country
 
must
 
strive
 
to
 
reduce
 
emissions
 
and
 
aim
 
for
 
carbon
 
neutrality.
 
We
 
know
 
this…yet
 
global
 
efforts
 
remain
 
far
 
behind
 
what
 
the
 
science
 
demands.
 
 
2
 
As
 
of
 
today,
 
only
 
four
 
countries
 
(just
 
4
 
countries)
 
-
 
(Bhutan,
 
Panama,
 
Suriname,
 
and
 
Madagascar)
 
are
 
carbon-neutral.
 
At
 
COP29
 
in
 
November
 
2024,
 
our
 
countries
 
came
 
together
 
to
 
launch
 
the
 
G-Zero
 
Forum,
 
a
 
coalition
 
of
 
carbon-neutral
 
nations
 
committed
 
to
 
accelerating
 
climate
 
ambition.
 
Our
 
message
 
is
 
clear:
 
net-zero
 
cannot
 
be
 
the
 
finish
 
line
 
—
 
it
 
must
 
be
 
the
 
starting
 
point.
 
Every
 
nation
 
must
 
work
 
urgently
 
to
 
slash
 
emissions
 
and
 
achieve
 
carbon
 
neutrality.
 
On
 
our
 
part:
 
●
 
We
 
will
 
share
 
best
 
practices
 
—
 
from
 
forest
 
conservation
 
to
 
sustainable
 
agriculture;
 
●
 
We
 
will
 
share
 
technologies
 
—
 
from
 
renewable
 
energy
 
systems
 
to
 
low-emission
 
transport;
 
●
 
We
 
will
 
champion
 
nature-based
 
solutions
 
—
 
because
 
forests
 
and
 
wetlands
 
are
 
not
 
just
 
landscapes;
 
they
 
are
 
like
 
vital
 
organs
 
-
 
the
 
lungs
 
and
 
kidneys
 
of
 
our
 
planet;
 
and
 
●
 
We
 
will
 
push
 
ambition
 
beyond
 
pledges
 
—
 
we
 
will
 
demand
 
measurable
 
results.
 
We
 
invite
 
all
 
countries
 
and
 
partners
 
to
 
join
 
us
 
in
 
this
 
effort.
 
The
 
science
 
is
 
unequivocal.
 
The
 
solutions
 
exist.
 
The
 
only
 
question
 
is:
 
do
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
will?
 
Excellencies,
 
While
 
reform
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
and
 
urgent
 
climate
 
actions
 
are
 
essential,
 
this
 
alone
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
enough.
 
We
 
must
 
now
 
reimagine
 
the
 
future
 
we
 
want.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
United
 
Nations,
 
over
 
half
 
of
 
humanity
 
now
 
lives
 
in
 
urban
 
areas,
 
and
 
by
 
2050
 
nearly
 
70
 
percent
 
-
 
(close
 
to
 
seven
 
billion
 
people)
 
-
 
will
 
call
 
cities
 
home.
 
Cities
 
drive
 
over
 
80
 
percent
 
of
 
global
 
GDP,
 
but
 
they
 
also
 
account
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
70
 
percent
 
of
 
energy-related
 
carbon
 
dioxide
 
emissions.
 
This
 
makes
 
cities
 
both
 
the
 
engines
 
of
 
innovation,
 
and
 
the
 
frontlines
 
of
 
our
 
greatest
 
challenges
 
-
 
challenges
 
like
 
unsustainable
 
consumption,
 
environmental
 
degradation,
 
and
 
rising
 
inequality.
 
We
 
face
 
a
 
choice:
 
we
 
can
 
keep
 
building
 
cities
 
that
 
consume
 
more
 
than
 
they
 
give,
 
or
 
we
 
can
 
reimagine
 
and
 
re-design
 
cities
 
that
 
heal,
 
sustain,
 
and
 
uplift.
 
3
 
Fifty
 
years
 
ago,
 
Bhutan
 
offered
 
the
 
world
 
Gross
 
National
 
Happiness
 
—
 
an
 
alternative
 
approach
 
to
 
development.
 
Today,
 
under
 
the
 
visionary
 
leadership
 
of
 
His
 
Majesty,
 
King
 
Jigme,
 
Bhutan
 
offers
 
the
 
world
 
an
 
alternative
 
approach
 
to
 
urban
 
living:
 
the
 
Gelephu
 
Mindfulness
 
City
 
-
 
A
 
city
 
founded
 
on
 
the
 
values
 
of
 
sustainability,
 
harmony
 
and
 
the
 
ideals
 
of
 
Gross
 
National
 
Happiness.
 
 
The
 
Gelephu
 
Mindfulness
 
City
 
is
 
a
 
Special
 
Administrative
 
Region
 
that
 
is
 
already
 
taking
 
shape
 
in
 
Bhutan.
 
With
 
executive
 
and
 
legislative
 
autonomy,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
an
 
independent
 
judiciary
 
now
 
established,
 
preparatory
 
works
 
are
 
already
 
underway
 
and
 
economic
 
clusters
 
are
 
being
 
advanced.
 
The
 
Gelephu
 
Mindfulness
 
City
 
is
 
not
 
an
 
idea
 
on
 
paper.
 
It
 
is
 
a
 
living
 
project
 
in
 
action.
 
 
The
 
Gelephu
 
Mindfulness
 
City
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
a
 
city
 
of
 
glass
 
towers
 
and
 
unchecked
 
sprawl.
 
Instead
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
a
 
place
 
where
 
modernity
 
and
 
tradition
 
meet
 
—
 
where
 
nature
 
is
 
the
 
foundation
 
of
 
urban
 
living.
 
 
Powered
 
by
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
built
 
with
 
sustainable
 
materials,
 
and
 
designed
 
for
 
low-carbon
 
living,
 
it
 
will
 
offer
 
inclusive
 
housing,
 
green
 
public
 
spaces,
 
and
 
meaningful
 
jobs.
 
For
 
Bhutan,
 
the
 
Mindfulness
 
City
 
is
 
a
 
strategic
 
step:
 
-
 
A
 
step
 
towards
 
taking
 
Gross
 
National
 
Happiness
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
level,
 
 
-
 
towards
 
advancing
 
economic
 
prosperity,
 
 
-
 
And
 
towards
 
fostering
 
deeper
 
global
 
engagement
 
-
 
without
 
losing
 
our
 
identity
 
or
 
our
 
bond
 
with
 
nature.
 
But
 
the
 
Gelephu
 
Mindfulness
 
City
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
Bhutan’s
 
project.
 
It
 
could
 
serve
 
as
 
a
 
forerunner
 
in
 
rethinking
 
urbanization
 
-
 
a
 
model
 
city
 
built
 
on
 
the
 
values
 
of
 
mindfulness,
 
sustainability,
 
and
 
shared
 
humanity.
 
I
 
extend
 
a
 
warm
 
invitation
 
for
 
all
 
of
 
you
 
to
 
join
 
us
 
on
 
this
 
exciting
 
journey.
  
A
 
journey
 
to
 
bring
 
a
 
Royal
 
Vision
 
to
 
life.
 
A
 
vision
 
of
 
how
 
cities
 
and
 
urban
 
living
 
can
 
heal,
 
inspire,
 
and
 
sustain
 
both
 
humankind
 
and
 
nature.
 
 
Excellencies,
 
The
 
founders
 
of
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
gave
 
us
 
more
 
than
 
an
 
institution.
 
They
 
gave
 
us
 
an
 
inheritance
 
of
 
hope
 
-
 
(and)
 
the
 
solemn
 
responsibility
 
to
 
carry
 
it
 
forward.
 
4
 
In
 
this
 
spirit,
 
and
 
mindful
 
of
 
the
 
troubled
 
times
 
we
 
live
 
in,
 
I
 
have
 
the
 
pleasure
 
of
 
announcing
 
that
 
Bhutan
 
will
 
host
 
the
 
Global
 
Peace
 
Prayer
 
Festival
 
later
 
this
 
year.
 
 
From
 
the
 
4th
 
to
 
the
 
17th
 
of
 
November
 
2025,
 
the
 
Global
 
Peace
 
Prayer
 
Festival
 
will
 
unite
 
spiritual
 
masters,
 
scholars,
 
and
 
practitioners
 
from
 
across
 
the
 
world
 
(and
 
across
 
traditions)
 
in
 
a
 
common
 
aspiration
 
for
 
peace,
 
healing,
 
and
 
harmony.
 
Through
 
the
 
recitation
 
of
 
Moenlam
 
Chenmo
 
or
 
global
 
peace
 
prayers,
 
the
 
sacred
 
Bazaguru
 
mantra,
 
the
 
Kalachakra
 
empowerment,
 
and
 
the
 
powerful
 
Jabshi
 
Gyap
 
ritual,
 
Bhutan
 
seeks
 
to
 
offer
 
not
 
only
 
a
 
spiritual
 
event,
 
but
 
also
 
a
 
diplomatic
 
and
 
cultural
 
contribution
 
to
 
world
 
peace.
 
For
 
Bhutan,
 
it
 
is
 
both
 
a
 
privilege
 
and
 
a
 
prayer
 
-
 
that
 
in
 
these
 
turbulent
 
times,
 
the
 
voice
 
of
 
a
 
small
 
Himalayan
 
nation,
 
may
 
help
 
nurture
 
the
 
great
 
cause
 
of
 
peace
 
for
 
all
 
humanity.
 
We
 
extend
 
a
 
warm
 
welcome
 
to
 
all
 
who
 
wish
 
to
 
join
 
the
 
Global
 
Peace
 
Prayer
 
Festival.
 
Excellencies,
 
 
This
 
is
 
our
 
moment.
 
Let
 
ours
 
be
 
the
 
generation
 
that
 
reforms
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
to
 
reflect
 
today’s
 
realities.
 
The
 
generation
 
that
 
confronts
 
the
 
climate
 
crisis
 
with
 
urgency
 
and
 
unity.
 
The
 
generation
 
that
 
makes
 
peace
 
not
 
merely
 
the
 
absence
 
of
 
war,
 
but
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
justice,
 
opportunity,
 
and
 
dignity
 
for
 
all.
 
And
 
when
 
the
 
United
 
Nations
 
marks
 
its
 
100th
 
anniversary,
 
we
 
will
 
proudly
 
affirm
 
that
 
we
 
honoured
 
the
 
vision
 
of
 
those
 
who
 
came
 
before
 
us,
 
and
 
inspired
 
hope
 
for
 
those
 
who
 
will
 
follow.
 
Thank
 
you
 
and
 
Tashi
 
Delek.
