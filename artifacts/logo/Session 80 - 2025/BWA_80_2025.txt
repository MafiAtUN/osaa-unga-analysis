 Madam President,  
Secretary General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen . 
 
1. We meet here today and this whole week ; in these 
hallowed precinct s, to remember the overwhelming 
gravity of the circumstances  that gave bi rth to th e 
United Nations. The ruins of war . A world poised to 
descend into fu rther mayhem , if courageous choices 
were not made. Leaders , of great vision and  courage , 
stepped up . They realized  that the charms and the 
allurements  of our unity, trumped any tendencies to 
divide us. And from their convictio n, that humanity  is 
better together , this institution  was born . Their 
courage and fortitude merits our recurrent 
admiration .

 2. So I stand, on this enchanted spot today to express 
my thanks , and the gratitude of the people of 
Botswana , to our fore -runners and to all of you. We 
must recommit ourselves to the vision: peace, 
development, and human ri ghts for all people , in all 
nations. I stand here today in the composite 
capacities of citizen  of Botswan a, and as an Africa n. 
Yes, I am an Africa n; stump and root.  
 
3. For Botswana, the ideals of the United N ations are 
not abstractions. They are the foundation of our 
identity . Since our Independence we have s ought to 
embody democratic governance, r espect for the rule 
of law - including an international rule -based 
normative order, and the dignity of every human 
being.

 4. We reaffirm  today our commitment to the Universal 
Declaration of Hum an Rights , and to ad vancing 
equality - including the protection of indigenous  
peoples, women and youth – within our borde rs and 
across our region.  Yet we also acknowledge tha t the 
pursuit of justice is an arduous  journey. My 
administration  has pledged to reform and strengthen  
institutions , enhance  transparency and root out 
corruption. We do so not for accolades, but be cause 
our cit izens deserve governments that serve them 
with integrity. We are on a quest for integrity in 
African leadership.  
 
5. Excellencies,  Botswana has been blessed with the gift 
of diamonds. For decades, this resource has financed 
schools, hospitals, and infrastructure. But today, we 
confront the fragility of that reliance. Diamond 
markets fluctuate. Our people’s needs do not  recede . 
5 
 Our vision is clear: to diversify our economy, 
empower our people, and create resilience. We invite 
global partners to invest in renewable energy, 
technology, sustainable agriculture, and value -added 
industries. We extend an open hand to businesses, 
innova tors, and institutions ready to walk with us on 
this journey of transformation.  
 
6. Botswana is a semi -arid nation. Our people know the 
meaning of drought. We know the anxiety of scarce 
water, of crops that wilt and wither under a relentless 
sun, of livelihoods eroded by forces beyond our 
control.  Climate change is not a distant threat; it is a 
present reality. That is why I have joined the Global 
Center on Adaptation, because adaptation must be 
at the centre of sustainable development.  I call on 
this Assembly to scale up financing for climate 
adaptation. Let us invest in water infrastructure, 
6 
 early warning systems, and climate -smart 
agriculture. Let us ensure that the promise of the 
Paris Agreement is not confined to paper, but 
realized in the lives of farmers, herders, and children 
across the Global South.  
 
7. Earlier this year, Botswana faced an acute shortage 
of essential medicines. This crisis exposed not only 
the vulnerabilities of our supply chains, but the wider 
inequities of the global health system.  Access to 
medicines is a human right, not a privilege. We call 
upon the United Nations, international financial 
institutions, and the private sector to work with us to 
build resilient health systems. Together, let us 
explore local production, regional supp ly hubs, and 
fairer mechanisms to ensure that no nation is left to 
face health emergencies alone.

 8. As an African I stan d here , as one of the trumpet 
voices of Africa, a continent to o often treated with 
affable indifference. Africa’s  voice is not heard.  This 
United Nations cannot be truly internation al; it 
cannot be truly toge ther, and will not be better until 
our continent - home to one fifth of the population of 
the wo rld- is afforded  an equal voice at the highest 
body of this organization . Friends and partners in the 
Permanent Five : it is time to make good on your 
promise to a continent. Agree a permanent seat on 
the UN Security Council for Africa , for 80 years the 
only continent wi thout one.  
 
9. I also welcome the decision by Britain, Australia , 
Canada, and France , to recogni ze the State of 
Palestine, joining other nations that have already 
done so. No people should be dispos sessed of their 
lands, and we stand in solidarity with the Palestinian 
8 
 people in their pursuit of a home and of dignity.  So 
too we reaffirm  our support fo r the sovereignty  and 
territorial inte grity of Ukraine . We urge all parties to 
stop the war, and seek a peaceful resolution.  
 
10. Distinguished delegates,  the theme of this General 
Assembly is “Better Together.” This is not a slogan; 
it is a truth. We are better together in combating 
pandemics, better together in adapting to climate 
change, better together in securing peace, and better 
together in ensuring th at human dignity is not the 
preserve of a few, but the inheritance of all.  Let us 
therefore recommit ourselves to multilateralism, not 
as a matter of convenience, but as a necessity. For 
none of us can weather the storms of this century 
alone.  
 
9 
 11. As Botswana looks to the future, we do so with 
humility, but also with determination. We stand 
ready to contribute, to partner, and to lead where we 
can. Together, let us ensure that when future 
generations mark 100 years of the United Nations, 
they will say of us: They were the generation that 
turned words into action, promises into progress, and 
hope into reality.  
 
I thank you.
