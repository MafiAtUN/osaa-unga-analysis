1 PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY PROF. FAUSTIN ARCHANGE TOUADERA OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, HEAD OF STATE, ON THE OCCASION OF THE 80TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 2025. - Madam President of the General Assembly; 2 - Majesties, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government; - Mr Secretary General of the United Nations; - Distinguished Delegates; - Ladies and gentlemen; It is with a deep sense of responsibility that I take the floor, on behalf of the Central African people, as our Organization celebrates its eighty (80) years of existence. This anniversary reminds us of a simple truth: our destinies are linked. Humanity is one and indivisible. Our people can only prosper if peace is assured, if development is shared and if human dignity is guaranteed for all. Eighty years after the founding of the UN, the world faces an accumulation of unprecedented threats: persistent wars, geopolitical rivalries, the rise of terrorism and organized crime, and an unprecedented climate, humanitarian and food crisis. Not since the Cold War have we seen such fragility. In Europe, the war in Ukraine continues to cause immense human suffering and weaken global stability. In the Middle East, persistent violence between Israel and Palestine is plunging entire generations into pain and compromising hopes of peaceful coexistence. In Africa, the crises in Sudan, in the East of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the Sahel and in the Horn of Africa, 3 remind us of the fragility of balances and the urgency of increased support for the prevention and peaceful resolution of disputes. Faced with these dramatic situations, the Central African Republic is proposing the strengthening of the UN's preventive diplomacy mechanisms, by creating a Global Conflict Prevention Fund supplied by the great powers and managed in a transparent manner. This fund should make it possible to finance, from the first signals of crisis, good offices missions, international mediations and the deployment of rapid and credible peacekeeping forces. Likewise, we must systematize the creation of regional coalitions of mediators capable of acting in addition to the United Nations to prevent local disputes from transforming into open wars. Madam President; If we want to measure the seriousness of the moment, let us look particularly at Africa. In 2025, more than 40% of armed conflicts in the world will take place on this continent. The Sahel alone concentrates thousands of victims each year and millions of displaced people. A single figure is enough to sum up the urgency: in certain African regions, one child in two lives in an area affected by conflict. How can we talk about the future when half a generation is threatened by war? 4 For the Central African Republic, we know that our stability conditions that of all of Central Africa. We also know that peace can never be achieved, but must always be built with patience and solidarity. To mitigate the harmful effects of climate change, we call for an integrated African food and climate security mechanism, supported by the UN, to reduce the link between resource scarcity and conflict. We call for structural and sustainable funding for peace operations in Africa, based on compulsory contributions and not on volunteers. We affirm that peace must be inclusive, ensuring the participation of women and youth. Without security, there is neither prosperity nor effective human rights. Faced with the conflicts and humanitarian crises that have put our world to the test, we must collectively recall the normative force of the Charter of the United Nations, this founding text which, in 1945, carried the hope of a world freed from the scourge of war. But today, 80 years later, the question arises: is the UN still capable of fulfilling this mission? The multiplication of conflicts, the fragmentation of the world into antagonistic blocs, the abusive use of the right of veto and the paralysis of the Security Council give us the impression of an Organization running out of steam. However, it is not the UN that is tired: it is the Member States who, by lacking political will, are blocking its action. 5 Yes, Madam President, the UN can still influence the concert of nations, but on one condition: that we, its members, choose consensus rather than division, unity rather than blockage. I welcome and encourage the constant efforts of the international community to promote peaceful outcomes to various conflicts. Because each day that passes prolongs the agony of innocent people and weakens world peace. In Africa, particularly in Sudan, unresolved conflicts are tearing apart a brotherly people and risk transforming our continent into a mosaic of confetti states, incapable of ensuring stability or meeting the needs of their citizens. This prospect is unacceptable. Africa calls for urgent mobilization, not to further militarize our territories, but to invest in peace, mediation and inclusive dialogue. This is why my country supports the QUAD Declaration, initiated by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States of America regarding the restoration of peace and security in Sudan. In my own country, the Central African Republic, we have chosen this path of dialogue. 6 The policy of outstretched hands has enabled, through reconciliation and restored trust, the self-dissolution of almost all armed groups. This choice was not the easiest: it would have been simpler to give in to the logic of weapons, but we preferred the audacity of forgiveness, the patience of dialogue and the strength of consensus. Our experience shows that it is possible to replace the cycle of hatred with a dynamic of lasting peace. The Central African Republic, once considered a theater of violence, is today an example that it is possible to extend a hand and obtain in return not war, but peace. Thanks to the renewed peace, we are preparing today, with complete serenity, the general elections of December 2025 which we want to be democratic, inclusive and transparent, to consolidate the democratic anchoring of the country initiated since 2016. We propose that this model be studied and strengthened as good African practice within the framework of the United Nations and the African Union. This good practice requires courageous political acts: reform the UN, reform the global financial architecture, create a global prevention fund, strengthen the role of regional organizations, mobilize the great powers not to divide but to unite. 7 The Central African Republic, with its experience, stands ready to contribute its experience to this vast project to build a world order based on justice, human dignity and respect for international law. But peace cannot be enough without development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains our common course. We work to reduce poverty, strengthen food security, promote education and health as levers of dignity, and initiate reforms for inclusive growth that creates jobs and is respectful of the environment. The Central African Republic today affirms a simple conviction: sustainable development and international cooperation are the keys to world peace. In a world where crises follow one another and intertwine, no country can meet the challenges of the century alone. We need solidarity active. We need truly shared prosperity. We need a burst of humanity. For this burst of humanity, allow me, Madam President, to deliver three (3) simple but essential messages: First, inclusive development is a weapon of prevention. Where there is exclusion, poverty and injustice, anger builds, resentments accumulate and conflicts erupt. 8 But where we invest in education, health and employment, the seeds of peace grow. An open school is not just benches full of students, it is a society that chooses the future rather than violence. A job created is not just an income, it is dignity preserved and a family that believes in peace again. Second, international cooperation is vital. Our challenges ignore borders. Climate, pandemics, migrations, markets: all of this is beyond the capabilities of each isolated state. No wall, no closed port, no barrier provides lasting protection against a storm, a virus or migratory despair. The only protection is collective action, it is multilateralism. Third, sustainable development is also a moral debt to our children. Will we leave them with a bloodless planet, an ecological and social debt which will condemn them before they have even started their adult lives? Or will we pass on to them a fairer, greener, more dignified world? This choice cannot wait any longer. Madam President; For a fairer world, the Central African Republic today wishes to chart paths for the future, by sharing three paths which are not simple technical proposals, but civilizational choices. 9 First, we need to imagine a global initiative for the reconstruction of fragile states. Because a world that leaves some of its members broken cannot claim universal peace. Nations scarred by conflict must no longer be left alone to heal their wounds. They need an international community that lifts them up, supports them and gives them confidence. Investing in institutional reconstruction means refusing the endless cycle of war and despair. To this institutional reconstruction must then be added a strong commitment to our planet. This is why we are calling for a United Nations Compact for the Protection of Critical Ecosystems, a pact that links climate, biodiversity and human rights. Destroying a forest does not just mean cutting down trees, it means erasing crops, threatening lives and preparing for the crises of tomorrow. Protecting nature means protecting peace. Finally, it is time to dream big for Africa. This is the meaning of the idea of ​​a Green Development Corridor in Central Africa, which combines modern infrastructure, clean energy and regional integration. From Bangui to Kinshasa, from Douala to Libreville, this corridor would be a link between our peoples and a promise of the future for all humanity. 10 Because Africa is not a continent to be assisted, it is a continent to be revealed. She expects neither charity nor compassion, but just and courageous partnerships. The era of Africa’s dependence is over. The role of Africa in the concert of Nations must be respected: sovereignty and non-subordination; partnership and not exploitation. It is unacceptable to see poverty worsening in Africa while wealth accumulates in the countries of the North. It is time for the injustices caused to Africa to be repaired. This is why the Central African Republic supports the pan-African initiative on reparations as well as the continent's efforts to establish a respectful and equitable dialogue with partners. In this vein, my country supports the initiative for global governance launched on September 1, 2025, by China and which is an extension of global initiatives for development, security and civilization emphasizing the construction of a fairer and more equitable system of international governance. Madam President; We all agree on the principle of sustainable development. But two obstacles remain: financing and the distribution of responsibilities between the North and the South. 11 On these two points, it is time to speak the truth. Everyone must take their part, according to their means and their historical responsibilities. Because solidarity is not a moral option: it is a political obligation. This political obligation implies that sustainable development is the very condition of our common future. The Central African Republic, despite its modest means, but with an unwavering political will, takes its full place in this collective fight. We know we are vulnerable. But we also know that our vulnerability gives us a unique voice: one that reminds the world that peace, justice and solidarity are not distant promises, but urgent choices, here and now. On this 80th anniversary, the Central African Republic reaffirms its unwavering attachment to the values ​​embodied by the UN. But it emphasizes that these values ​​cannot be guaranteed without a profound reform of the multilateral system, and in particular of the United Nations Security Council, whose current composition has become anachronistic and illegitimate. Eighty years ago, when the United Nations was born, Africa was not free. Most of our countries still lived under colonial rule. Our voice didn't count. Today, Africa has one billion four hundred million inhabitants. In thirty years, it will be two billion five hundred million. One in four human beings will be African. Africa will be the youngest and most decisive continent of the century. 12 And yet, not a single permanent seat on the Security Council belongs to Africa. Not a single one. How can we talk about security and international justice when the continent of tomorrow is treated like that of yesterday? The Central African Republic carries the voice of Africa here to say: enough! Africa must have two permanent seats with veto power, not out of favor but out of justice, not out of privilege but out of necessity. We also propose the creation of a Global Charter for Digital Governance and Ethical Artificial Intelligence, so that human rights are protected in the digital space. We call for the establishment of a global index of equity and democratic resilience, complementary to GDP, to measure dignity, justice and inclusion. My country is already acting on its own scale. We validated our third report on Resolution 1325 “Women, Peace and Security”. We have updated our Beijing +30 follow-up plan. We are strengthening our national accountability mechanisms to place women, young people and the most vulnerable at the heart of public policies. On this eightieth anniversary of the UN, let us recall the vision of the founders: to replace the force of the powerful with the force of law, and to build a future of dignity for all. Thank you.
