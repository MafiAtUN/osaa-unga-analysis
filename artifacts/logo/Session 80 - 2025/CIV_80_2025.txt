Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with pride that I speak on behalf of the Government of Côte d’Ivoire on the occasion of this 30th anniversary of the World Program of Action for Youth. This commemoration is a pressing invitation to accelerate progress, strengthen solidarity between generations and translate our commitments into concrete and sustainable policies. In Ivory Coast, this ambition found its full expression, under the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Alassane OUATTARA, President of the Republic, who placed, from 2011, youth at the heart of his national reconstruction project. 3 Indeed, he made the choice to consider youth not as a burden, but as a strategic lever for national transformation. This choice guided the profound reform of our public policies regarding youth. In less than fifteen years, our country has built a complete, structured and inclusive ecosystem. Two national youth policies (2016 -2020 and 2021 - 2025) were adopted, accompanied by a Government Youth Program for the period 2023 -2025, equipped with ambitious resources. An orientation law has been promulgated: it enshrines their rights and duties, a youth impact clause and the representativeness of young people in elected assemblies. Furthermore, structuring institutions have emerged, such as the Youth Employment Agency, the National Civic Service Office and the National Youth Council. Beyond institutional reforms, tangible results have been recorded. 4 More than two million young people have been supported in employment, training, entrepreneurship or civic service. Nearly one million five hundred thousand formal jobs have been created, the majority in the private sector. More than three hundred and forty thousand young entrepreneurs have been funded and more than fifty-five thousand have been mobilized in volunteering and citizen engagement initiatives. These figures demonstrate an assumed policy, equipped with resources, taken to the highest level of the State. They also reflect a desire to transform our youth to make them more aware, more active and now actors of their own destiny. Today it is consulted, listened to and associated with the formulation and evaluation of public policies. This involvement of young people is achieved through innovative participatory mechanisms, such as the national consultations which prevailed in the design of the Government Youth Program 2023 -2025 and as part of the ongoing development of the National Development Plan (2026 -2030). 5 On this solemn day, Côte d'Ivoire calls for a new global ambition for youth, based on: - the recognition of youth as political actors in their own right; - the creation of an international fund dedicated to its employment and integration; - the establishment of a global youth performance index; and - the institutionalization of intergenerational governance as a requirement of democratic justice. Thank you.
