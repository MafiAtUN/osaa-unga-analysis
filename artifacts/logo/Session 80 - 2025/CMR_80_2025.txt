ALLOW ME IN THIS CAUSE, TO RENEW YOU THE WARM CONGRATULATIONS OF CAMEROON FOLLOWING YOUR ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE 80TH SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF OUR ORGANIZATION. YOUR DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE AND YOUR VISION, WHICH ENCOURAGE US TO JOIN OUR EFFORTS FOR A BETTER FUTURE, ARE GUARANTEES OF SUCCESS OF BOTH YOUR MANDATE AND OF OUR DELIBERATIONS THROUGHOUT THIS SESSION. YOU CAN COUNT, IN THIS REGARD, ON THE FULL COOPERATION OF THE CAM EROUN DELEGATION. AS YOU KNOW, MY COUNTRY WAS HONORED TO SEE YOUR PREDECESSOR, AMBASSADOR PHILEMON YANG, CHAIR THE 79TH SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE COMMITMENT, PROFESSIONALISM AND DETERMINATION, IMPROVED BY A SENSE OF LISTENING AND DIALOGUE WHICH HE HAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF HIS MANDATE. LET ME ALSO REITERATE TO MR. ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THE SINCERE APPRECIATION OF CAMEROON FOR ITS TILTLESS EFFORTS AT THE HEAD OF OUR ORGANIZATION AND ITS MANIFEST DESIRE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF MULTILATERALISM IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCIES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, 3 DISTINGUISHED REPRESENTATIVES, WE ARE GATHERING THIS YEAR AT A KEY MOMENT IN OUR ORGANIZATION, WHICH CELEBRATES ITS 80 YEARS. CELEBRATING A BIRTHDAY IS ALWAYS THE OBJECT OF JOY. BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE CURRENT CELEBRATION LEAVES US RATHER QUESTIONING. ALSO, WE ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ITS ASSESSMENT AND TO REFLECT ON WAYS AND MEANS OF MAKING IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS MISSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROMISES CONTAINED IN ITS CHARTER. IN THIS REGARD, MADAM PRESIDENT, YOU HAVE PROPOSED THE SHARING OF OUR WILLS, OUR EFFORTS AND OUR RESOURCES. YOU RIGHTLY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE “BETTER TOGETHER”. CAMEROON SHARE THIS VISION WITH YOU AND WELCOMES THE CHOICE OF THE THEME FOR OUR DISCUSSIONS. I QUOTE: “LIVE BETTER TOGETHER, 80 YEARS AND OVER FOR PEACE, DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS”, END OF QUOTE. THIS THEME IS MORE THAN A SLOGAN. THIS IS A RELEVANT PROGRAM THAT WE MUST TAKE OUT AT THE LEVEL OF STATES AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, IN CONCRETE ACTIONS. THE UNION OF OUR FORCES IS THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER. ITS FOUNDING FATHERS WERE AWARE THAT MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, PROMOTING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL, COULD ONLY BE THE FRUIT OF COLLECTIVE WORK. THIS IS WHY WE MUST MAINTAIN THIS DYNAMICS, FOR THE WELL-BEING OF OUR POPULATIONS. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, 4 THE UN WAS CREATED TO BE BOTH A VECTOR OF HOPE, A FORUM FOR DIALOGUE AND A CATALYST FOR CONCRETE ACTION TO BUILD A JUST, SAFER AND MORE UNION WORLD. 80 YEARS LATER, IT IS USEFUL AS I JUST HIGHLIGHTED ABOVE, TO TAKE AN ASSESSMENT AND TO DRAW LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE. THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS Arise: DID WE GET THERE? HAVE WE SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING OUR PEOPLES SAFE FROM FEAR OF WAR, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR FUTURE, AND FAMINE? THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL SITUATION, CHARACTERIZED BY MANY CRISES, OFFERS US A NEGATIVE AND ELOQUENT ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS. IN 2025, THE GLOBAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT UNFORTUNATELY REMAINS MARKED BY A MULTIPLICATION OF CONFLICTS AND THREATS OF ALL KINDS AGAINST HUMAN SECURITY, INCLUDING THE NUCLEAR THREAT THAT WAS THOUGHT FROM ANOTHER TIME. WHETHER IN EUROPE, CENTRAL ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST, LATIN AMERICA AND AFRICA, FOCUS OF TENSIONS ARISE OR PERSIST, AND ENDANGER INTERNATIONAL PEACE, STABILITY AND SECURITY MORE THAN IN THE PAST. THE CURRENTLY ONGOING ARMED CONFLICTS IN THE WORLD ARE A PAINFUL REMINDER THAT, 80 YEARS LATER, WE HAVE NEITHER BEABLE OR KNOWLEDGE TO PRESERVE THE WORLD FROM THE SCOPE OF WAR. THIS SITUATION IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE MOST VARIOUS NATURAL DISASTERS. THESE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, EXTREME NATURAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS STORMS, HURRICANES, FOREST FIRES, EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER LANDSLIDES CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL DAMAGE AND SEVERAL 5 LOSS OF HUMAN LIVES, WITHOUT OMITTING THE DIFFERENT PANDEMICS. THE WORLD WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPMENT IF IT WINS THAT OF PEACE. WE HAVE THE HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY TO CHOOSE: EITHER TO ALLOW WAR AND THESE MULTIPLE PLAGUES TO PROSPER, OR TO OFFER OUR CHILDREN A STABLE, UNITED AND PROSPEROUS WORLD. CAMEROON HAS MADE ITS CHOICE, THAT OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT, AND IS STANDING REsolutely AT YOUR SIDE TO TRANSFORM THIS ASPIRATION INTO A SHARED REALITY. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THERE CAN BE NO DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT PEACE, NOR LASTING PEACE WITHOUT DEVELOPMENT. THE CURRENT CRISES, WHICH HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND THE SUPPLY OF MARKETS ARE UNDUBTABLY HOLDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY COUNTRIES. YET, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, REMAINS A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE THAT THE UNITED NATIONS SHOULD ACHIEVE FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE POPULATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS HOWEVER, WE NOTE WITH REGRET THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STILL LIVE IN EXTREME POVERTY, PRECARITY BACKED TO DISEASES AND FOOD INSECURITY. IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT, CHILDREN, WOMEN, THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH REDUCED MOBILITY ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE. WHILE ACCESS TO EDUCATION HAS EXPANDED, MANY CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A DECLINE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY, A DEGRADATION OF HEALTH INDICATORS AND A CRITICAL INSUFFICIENCY IN THE NUMBER OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, PARTICULARLY IN AFRICA. FIVE YEARS AWAY FROM THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, IT IS URGENT THAT CONCERTED ACTION BE TAKEN TO KEEP THE PROMISES CONTAINED IN THE 2030 AGENDA. WE MUST ACTUALLY TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES, INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIONALLY, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE SET OURSELVES VOLUNTARILY. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, CAMEROON, A PUPIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, REMAINS ATTACHED TO THE OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES OF THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, AND MAKES NO EFFORT, UNDER THE VERY HIGH IMPULSE OF H.E. PAUL BIYA, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, FOR THE PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT MY COUNTRY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES IN UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS, AND WORKS, THANKS TO ITS THREE MAJOR SPECIALIZED SCHOOLS, IN THE TRAINING OF AGENTS AND EXECUTIVES OF THE POLICE, THE GENDARMERY AND OTHER AFRICAN CIVILIANS WHO TAKE PART IN THESE OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CAMEROON REMAINS CONSTANTLY COMMITTED TO THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IN GENERAL, EVEN IN THE SAHEL AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE LAKE CHAD BASIN WHERE THE BOKO HARAM SECT LIVES. IN ECONOMIC MATTERS, MY COUNTRY HAS HAD AN AMBITIOUS NATIONAL STRATEGY, WHICH PROMOTES HARMONIOUS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENTIRE NATION, WHILE PROMOTING PROGRESS IN 7 DEMOCRACY, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS ALLOWS US TO PROGRESSIVELY AND METHODICALLY ACHIEVE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE AFRICAN UNION AGENDA 2063, AMONG OTHERS. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, IN THE CONGO BASIN, CAMEROON IS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, THE PROTECTION OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY. HE WILL ALWAYS DO HIS PART AND EXPECTS THAT THE PROMISES MADE, IN TERMS OF FINANCING, WILL BE KEPT. FOR CAMEROON, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE EFFORTS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BE SUPPORTED. IN THIS REGARD, IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED ONCE AGAIN, THAT MORE THAN A DECADE AGO, DEVELOPED COUNTRIES MADE A COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT TO MOBILIZE 100 BILLION US DOLLARS PER YEAR TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS THE SAME FOR DEVELOPMENT AID SET AT 0.7% FOR AROUND FIFTY YEARS. SO FAR, ALL THESE PROMISES HAVE NOT BEEN KEPT. CAMEROON BELIEVES THAT IT IS TIME FOR THE EXPECTED FUNDS TO BE ACTUALLY MOBILIZED TO SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT EFFORTS MADE BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES INCLUDING THOSE IN AFRICA, SO THAT OUR COMMON ENVIRONMENT IS PRESERVED, FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL. ON ANOTHER LEVEL, A GENERAL MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES IS OPERATING IN CAMEROON IN FAVOR OF MAJOR PROJECTS IN THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION, HEALTH, INFRASTRUCTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT ETC, IN VIEW 8 TO BRING A STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION TO THE COUNTRY. WE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK OUR MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL PARTNERS WHO SUPPORT US IN THIS DYNAMICS. WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO STRENGTHEN THIS PARTNERSHIP TO ALLOW US TO ACHIEVE THE EXPECTED OBJECTIVES. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, THE PACT FOR THE FUTURE AND ITS TWO ANNEXES, NAMELY, THE DIGITAL PACT AND THE DECLARATION ON FUTURE GENERATIONS CALL ON US FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. ALSO, THE RECENT FINAL DOCUMENTS OF THE NICE AND SEVILLE CONFERENCES, AS WELL AS THE YAOUNDE DECLARATION ON THE SUSTAINABLE BLUE ECONOMY IN THE GULF OF GUINEA, COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAIN ON FUNDING AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY IN THIS AGE OF DIGITAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS DECISIVE FACTORS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. CAMEROON WELCOMES THIS ADVANCES AS WELL AS THE COMMITMENTS MADE DURING THESE OCCASIONS FOR THE REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE AND THE ENERGY TRANSITION. MY COUNTRY ARDENTLY ASPIRES FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OTHER LONG-AWAITED REFORMS, IN PARTICULAR THAT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, TO ALLOW AFRICA TO OCCUPANT IT’S RIGHTED PLACE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EZULWINI CONSENSUS AND THE SYRTE DECLARATION. IN THE MATTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS, CAMEROON WELCOMES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PACT ON THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT. THE EVENTUAL ADOPTION OF THIS IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT WILL MARK THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY BY DECLARING, UNEQUIVOCALLY, THAT DEVELOPMENT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND NOT A FAVOR. MADAM PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCES, LADIES, GENTLEMEN, MR. SECRETARY GENERAL, AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED NATIONS, IT IS UP TO US TO ACT AND IT IS AN IMPERATIVE OBLIGATION FROM WHICH WE COULD NOT ESCAPE. FINANCING DEVELOPMENT, THE MATERIALIZATION OF OUR PROMISES IN FAVOR OF PEACE, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR CHOICES REGARDING HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. IT IS STILL UP TO US, FOR YEARS TO COME, TO STRENGTHEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF LASTING PEACE, ANCHORED IN PREVENTION, RESILIENCE AND JUSTICE. WE HAVE THE MEANS, ESPECIALLY AT THIS MOMENT WHEN GLOBAL WEALTH IN 2025 REACHES UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS, AND WHERE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF EVERYONE. IN CONCLUSION AND BY WAY OF EXHORTATION, WE MUST THEREFORE DO BETTER AND MORE SO THAT THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION KEEP THE PROMISES MADE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, AND THAT IT BECOMES MORE THAN EVER THE ENGINE OF A STRENGTHENED MULTILATERALISM; OF FAIR AND EQUITABLE COOPERATION, AND OF A RETHINKED SOLIDARITY IN THE FACE OF THE WORRYING ADVANCE OF MULTIPOLARITY. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. /-
