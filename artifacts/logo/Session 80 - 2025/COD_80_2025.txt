SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY FELIX -ANTOINE TSHISEKEDI TSHILOMBO, PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, ON THE OCCASION OF THE 80TH ORDINARY SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY New York, September 23, 2025 2 Madam President, Mr. Secretary General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to extend my warm congratulations to Ms. Annalena Baerbock on her election to the presidency of the 80th ordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly. His leadership and commitment to multilateralism will be decisive for the success of our work. I also take the opportunity offered by this platform to pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Philémon Yang, whose commitment and dedication marked the previous session. Finally, I reaffirm my country's full confidence in the action of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. António Guterres, for his constant efforts to strengthen our Organization and promote solutions to the challenges that threaten peace, security and prosperity in the world, particularly in the Great Lakes region of Africa, of which the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a part. 3 Madam President, I salute the relevance of the theme chosen for this 80th session — “Better together: more than 80 years in the service of peace, development and human rights”. It highlights eight decades of joint efforts by an Organization dedicated to peace, development and universal well-being, founded on an unwavering promise of collective security. The 80th anniversary of the United Nations, guarantor of this security since 1945, is an opportunity to reaffirm the virtues of effective multilateralism and to pay tribute to the ideal of peace, human dignity and solidarity between nations which inspired its founders. If the United Nations remains a pillar of the regulation of international relations, the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, it is today faced with systemic challenges which test its credibility and its capacity for action. The profound changes of our time, notably the persistence of armed conflicts, climate change, recurring humanitarian crises and protean transnational threats, remind us that multilateralism is no longer an option, but an essential requirement that imposes itself on us. We remain convinced that the answers to the challenges of the 21st century can only emerge from collective solutions, based on cooperation, justice and shared responsibility. 4 Madam President, Following its election last June, the Democratic Republic of Congo is preparing to sit, as a non-permanent member, on the Security Council for the period 2026 –2027. I reiterate, on behalf of my country, our most sincere thanks to Member States for the trust and solidarity expressed. Our participation will be resolutely constructive and holistic. It will be structured around two inseparable priorities: peace and security, on the one hand, and conflict prevention and resolution, on the other hand. We also intend to actively contribute to the development and implementation of the New Agenda for Peace, in order to provide, in light of our potential and experience, impetus to the reform of peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, as well as to the adaptation of the United Nations collective security system. Regarding Security Council reform, my country reaffirms the African Common Position, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration: Africa must benefit from two seats additional seats in the category of non-permanent members and two seats in that of permanent members, with the same rights — including the right of veto —, the same privileges and the same obligations as the current permanent members. With its 54 States and more than 1.2 billion inhabitants, Africa cannot remain on the sidelines of decisions that affect international peace and security. 5 Madam President, Another priority area concerns the illegal exploitation of natural resources, one of the major and persistent causes of conflicts. The Democratic Republic of Congo intends to place exemplary governance of its strategic minerals at the heart of the debate, in order to guarantee their exploitation while respecting the principles of sustainable development, economic sovereignty and the well-being of the populations. On a global scale, breaking the toxic link between mining rents and the financing of non-state armed groups requires an integrated approach based on: the harmonization of due diligence and traceability rules, from mine to consumer; full transparency of supply chains and beneficial owners; independent control and audit mechanisms; reinforced operational cooperation between customs, judicial and financial authorities; targeted and effective sanctions against traffickers and their facilitation networks; and a resolute fight against corruption, backed by standards of good governance, the publicity of contracts and the traceability of payments. Of course, the human rights and transitional justice dimensions, as well as the “Women, Peace and Security” and “Youth, Peace and Security” agendas, remain inseparable from this action. Their effective consideration is the condition for a just, lasting and inclusive peace. 6 Madam President, On the eve of the establishment of the independent Commission of Inquiry decided by the United Nations Human Rights Council into the massacres perpetrated a few months ago by our aggressors and their proxies in the east of my country, I launch a solemn appeal to the international community: it has the moral and political duty to support this essential approach in order to establish the truth, provide justice to the victims and lay the foundations for a lasting, anchored peace in memory and shared responsibility. Madam President, As the planet heats up, marginalization deepens and conflicts multiply, the diagnosis which inspired, in July 2023, the vision of the Secretary-General's New Agenda for Peace remains fully relevant. The world is now facing multifaceted and profound crises; the fundamentals of prevention have been weakened; and international law, once powerfully recalled by the Charter of the United Nations – which enjoins States to refrain from resorting to threats or force – is too often flouted. Our collective security system is shaken: it cannot survive without a burst of solidarity of interests and respect for the rules. In this context, warlike rhetoric is regaining ground and we are helplessly witnessing the return of old demons: armed aggression, wars of predation of resources and conquest of “vital spaces”, which spare no continent. While the war between Israel and Hamas ravages the Gaza Strip - with the risk of regional extension - and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict continues, other hotbeds are flaring in Yemen, Burma and Syria. 7 The armed conflict which continues in my country is a tragic illustration of this. For three decades, peace and security have been broken in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This war has turned into a predatory enterprise: it has long gone beyond the military or geopolitical dimensions alone; it aims to plunder our resources, erase our collective memory and destroy our communities. The consequences are disastrous: millions of deaths, decimated families, nearly seven million displaced people, women and children targeted, villages wiped off the map, generations sacrificed. In several regions of the East, all the markers of an extermination project are present. The United Nations itself, through the Mapping Report, has documented the scale of the atrocities. It is not just a conflict: it is a silent genocide that has been hitting the Congolese people for more than thirty years. Last July again, more than three hundred civilians — including forty-eight women and nineteen children — were massacred in Rutshuru territory by the AFC/M23 with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces. These crimes are not isolated; they are part of a macabre continuity. I thank the United States of America for taking the initiative last month to convene a special session of the Security Council to examine these massacres documented by Human Rights Watch. To put an end to this conflict, the Security Council, by its resolution 2773 of February 21, 2025, notably demanded the withdrawal of the M23 from the cities of Goma, Bukavu and all areas under its control, the dismantling of parallel administrations established in violation of the sovereignty of the 8 Democratic Republic of Congo as well as the cessation of all support, direct or indirect, to the M23. In this regard, I salute the leadership of President Donald Trump, who created the conditions for a dialogue which led, on June 27, 2025 in Washington, to the signing of a Peace Agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. This Agreement expressly commits Kigali to a complete and verifiable withdrawal of its troops, and to the lifting of its so-called “defensive” measures. It also provides for the disengagement, disarmament and conditional integration of non-state armed groups within the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Congolese National Police, the establishment of a joint security coordination mechanism, as well as a system guaranteeing respect for territorial integrity and the cessation of hostilities. The withdrawal of Rwandan troops, the end of their support for the M23 and the return of the authority of the Congolese state over all occupied areas constitute non-negotiable conditions for true peace. I ask the United Nations to ensure the strict application of this Agreement, which is now inseparable from the implementation of the aforementioned resolution. Until these decisions are carried out, the blood of innocent people will continue to flow. In the same dynamic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 signed, on July 19, 2025, in Doha, a Declaration of Principles committing the parties to work together towards a peaceful solution. I would like to express my gratitude to His Highness the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, for his dedication and commitment to peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes region. 9 Finally, I would like to express my high appreciation for the coordination provided by His Excellency Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé, President of the Council of Ministers of Togo, within the framework of the Lomé process. This dynamic comes from the convergence of the efforts of the Luanda process, led consistently by His Excellency João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President of the Republic of Angola and current Chairman of the African Union, and the Nairobi process, facilitated by His Excellency Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, former President of the Republic of Kenya. Together, these initiatives laid the foundation for a unified regional facilitation mechanism. A momentum that we intend to continue to preserve continental cohesion, strengthen coordination between African initiatives and consolidate a harmonized framework of action in order to restore, in a lasting manner, peace in the East of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our objective remains unchanged: to obtain a just, lasting and verifiable peace - not an artificial and ephemeral lull which, for nearly thirty years, has too often disappointed the hopes of our people. We expect the international community to stand, with constancy and courage, on the side of law. It is at this price that truth will prevail over impunity and peace will become possible again. Madam President, It should be noted that the diplomatic process initiated with all parties to the conflict in no way excludes the quest for justice and reparation. If the world still hesitates to name our pain, we will not wait. We are the first witnesses to it; we will be the first artisans of justice. But we need your solidarity, your support and full respect for international law. 10 The Democratic Republic of Congo does not seek charity or commiseration: it demands justice, truth and dignity. Our country has reached out: we have signed peace agreements, accepted dialogue, made commitments to reconciliation. But a fake peace, built on impunity and forgetting, is only a precarious armistice. History will not judge our speeches, but our ability to recognize mass crimes, including genocides, and to put an end to impunity. Madam President, The Democratic Republic of Congo is a country of life, natural wealth and human resilience. We want to contribute to world peace, but peace begins with recognizing our own tragedy. I address a solemn appeal to this Assembly: recognize the Congolese genocide, support our fight for truth and justice, and help us finally build lasting peace in the heart of Africa. We demand that the United Nations establish a regime of targeted sanctions against the perpetrators of economic crimes, but also war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide committed in the east of my country, and that they support all actions aimed at drying up the illicit mineral supply circuits which have financed, for decades, war and human tragedy. These actions must be carried out with the support of the African Union, the United Nations and our development partners, involving neighboring States, the companies that purchase and process these blood minerals, the financial institutions through which the flows pass, as well as civil society organizations. 11 I solemnly say it before this Assembly: the international community has the moral and political duty to recognize this tragedy for what it is – a genocide – and to act accordingly. Silence and inaction in the face of these crimes amount to complicity. We demand the immediate establishment of an international Commission of Inquiry, independent and equipped with means, to establish the truth, provide justice to the victims and break the cycle of impunity which has fueled this tragedy for decades. Madam President, Terrorism remains a serious threat to international peace and security: no region of the world is spared. After Asia, Western Europe and North America, this scourge is taking root in Africa and destabilizing several sub-regions. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, although weakened by international action, retains capabilities in gray areas and spreads its influence. Boko Haram in northern Nigeria and Al-Shabaab in Somalia maintain significant territorial influence. In Central Africa, after the devastation caused by Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), the North-East of the Democratic Republic of Congo suffered abuses from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan terrorist group that has pledged allegiance to the “Islamic State”. These extremist groups have left behind a heavy human toll and continue to threaten regional stability. Member of the Global Coalition against Daesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo calls on the United Nations to commit more resolutely to the implementation of the recommendations of the said Coalition and the Aqaba Process, namely: increased intelligence sharing, drying up of funding, the fight against propaganda and against sanctuaries, as well as increased support 12 for victim communities, in full respect of international humanitarian law. Madam President, Faced with the climate emergency, the Paris Agreement remains the essential legal framework for the accountability of States in terms of emissions and adaptation, in order to contain warming to 1.5°C. As such, the Democratic Republic of Congo adopted its National Adaptation Plan 2022 – 2026. We are committed to stopping and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2031, while promoting sustainable development and inclusive rural transformation. Since December 2021, a set of measures has supported the restoration of forest landscapes, including the “School Garden” Program for a billion trees by 2030, intended to strengthen CO₂ sequestration and the resilience of ecosystems. We welcome the adoption of decision 5/CMA.5 establishing new financing mechanisms, including the Loss and Damage Fund, to complement existing sources and provide concrete responses to the most exposed countries. With its unique environmental potential in the world, the Democratic Republic of Congo is at the heart of solutions: it is ready to mobilize its natural assets in the service of the global climate, provided that financial commitments are predictable, accessible and meet ecological and human imperatives. 13 Madam President, Allow me to also address the question of energy challenges and the protection of our ecosystems by recalling that the Congo basin is home to the second largest tropical forest in the world — considered by many scientists to be the first terrestrial carbon sink — as well as a vast hydrographic network dominated by the Congo River, second in the world by its flow. These vital resources are seriously threatened by destructive activities – deforestation, illegal logging, pollution – often fueled by recurring armed conflicts, which amount to real crimes against nature. This is why the Democratic Republic of Congo supports the initiative led by Vanuatu, Fiji and Samoa aimed at establishing, at the international level, ECOCIDE as an independent incrimination to punish illegal or arbitrary acts causing serious damage to the environment. Madam President, The adoption of the Pact for the Future recalls the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals five years before the 2030 deadline. The Democratic Republic of Congo has placed this imperative at the heart of its action through the National Strategic Development Plan 2024 –2028, which places Congolese people at the center of priorities and integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development – ​​environmental, social and economic. This plan is structured around clear guidelines, namely: consolidating security and democratic governance, modernizing infrastructure and the business climate, protecting the environment, and guaranteeing access to basic social services (water, sanitation, education, health). 14 The results remain mixed – only SDGs 12 and 13 still appear achievable by 2030 – but tangible progress has been recorded: free education has enabled more than five million children to return to school; the Cover universal health expands access to quality care; women’s empowerment policies reduce socio-economic disparities. However, these achievements remain weakened by the persistent insecurity in the east of the country and by the vulnerability of our economy to exogenous shocks. Our economy must therefore transform to become a lever of sustainability and prosperity. Country solution to climate challenges, my country intends to promote its forests, peatlands and biodiversity within a climate economy oriented towards green, resilient and low-carbon growth. In this regard, the Grand Inga project — one of the largest hydroelectric complexes in the world — embodies our ambition and strengthens the positioning of the Democratic Republic of Congo as a solution country: providing clean and competitive energy to electrify our territories, decarbonize our industry, support regional energy integration and pave the way for new uses, including green hydrogen. This trajectory is based on the development of integrated carbon markets, the attraction of responsible investments and the creation of decent jobs and sustainable livelihoods for our communities. However, there remains a major obstacle: financial constraints. The growing burden of African public debt, combined with illicit financial flows, is reducing our room for maneuver. Additional needs to achieve the SDGs in Africa are estimated at $1.6 trillion; at the same time, illicit capital outflows undermine our currencies and macroeconomic stability. 15 Hence the need for urgent reform of the international financial architecture in order to guarantee developing countries fair and predictable access to concessional financing, aligned with their national trajectories — including through better rechannelization of SDRs, the capitalization of multilateral development banks, countercyclical liquidity facilities and a reinforced fight against illicit flows. Madam President, Since my accession to the supreme office of my country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, I have given a new dynamic to the conduct of public affairs, systematically integrating the gender dimension at all levels in order to ensure an increased presence of women in decision-making bodies. As an illustration, the share of women in Government increased from 17% in 2019 to 32% in 2025. Madam President, In a strategic and multisectoral approach aimed at mobilizing youth in the service of national progress, my Government has adopted a National Youth Policy. This establishes the State's commitment to making the full participation of young people in the life of the Nation a transversal priority, accompanied by clear and measurable objectives. 16 Madam President, The Democratic Republic of Congo aspires to peace, justice and development. She is ready to act, alongside you, for a stronger, more inclusive and fairer United Nations. With its human, natural and strategic assets, my country intends to put them at the service of a better future for future generations and our common home, planet Earth. May God bless humanity and grant us the grace of true and lasting peace among all the nations of the world. Thank you.
