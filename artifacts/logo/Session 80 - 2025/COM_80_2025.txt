0 UNION OF THE COMOROS Unity - Solidarity - Development _________ Speech by His Excellency Mr. AZALI Assoumani President of the Union of the Comoros On the occasion of the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly New York, September 24, 2025 1 - Excellency Madam President of the General Assembly, - Majesties, Highnesses, - Excellencies, Heads of delegation, - Honorable guests, - Ladies and Gentlemen, Please allow me first of all, // to address to the American Authorities, // on behalf of the Comorian delegation, // our sincere thanks // for the warm welcome // and the excellent arrangements made // on the occasion of this 80th Session // of our Assembly. I would then like // to congratulate Her Excellency Mrs. Annalena Baerbock // for her election as president of this Session, // and to pay tribute // to His Excellency Mr. Philémon Yang // for the wisdom and rigor with which // he conducted the previous work. Finally, I salute // the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, // Secretary General of the United Nations, // whose commitment // to peace and development // faithfully embodies // the ideals of our Charter, // while the international order is going through profound turbulence. Madam President, The theme of this 80th Session, // “Better together: // more than 80 years in the service of peace, // development and human rights”, // takes on all its relevance and urgency, // in the current global context. 2 Ten years ago here, // we set the ambition for a better world // by 2030. The Sustainable Development Goals were supposed to // eradicate poverty, // protect the planet // and offer prosperity and peace to all. However, // five years from this deadline, // it is clear that the world is neither more just, // nor more peaceful, nor more equitable. On the contrary, // inequalities are increasing, // conflicts are multiplying // and Humanity is moving away from the vision that animated us. The Palestinian tragedy // is the most overwhelming testimony to this. For more than 70 years // and today even more than yesterday, // the Palestinian people have endured the dispossession of their ancestral land, // exile, torture and humiliation. Its recent history // is only a succession of pages written in blood, // indifference and contempt. Faced with this tragedy, // rightly described as genocide // by a number of experts, // the international community // is too often limited to verbal condemnations, // without concrete actions. We have rightly condemned // the terrorist acts of October 7 // but the disproportionate response // which has taken place in Gaza since then // is indeed a genocide // 80% of whose victims are // children, the elderly and the sick // killed by bombings // which spare neither the hospitals // nor the aid distribution centers // nor the UN personnel, // nor journalists. 3 The crimes perpetrated against Palestine // reveal an unbearable contradiction: Indeed, // how, // can a government, coming from a people who were victims of the holocaust, // commit genocide, // in full view of the whole world // and impose today on others // the similar traumas, // of war, exile // and oppression. How can Israel, moreover, // attack everyone and be in deadly conflict // with all its neighbors? As an old adage reminds us, // you don't choose your neighbor. We cannot fail to salute // the courage and humanism // of the Israelis who raise their voices against barbarism. And as History reminds us, // faced with the tragedy of the Holocaust, // Arab, African countries and Muslims // have never been on the side of the genocidaires. On the contrary, // our ancestors were on the side of the allies // to defend the Jewish people, at the risk of their life. Madam President, The Union of the Comoros, // faithful to its principles and respect for international law, // reaffirms its unwavering support for the two-State solution, // with East Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, // the only solution for peace and security, // for Israel and the entire region of the Near and Middle East because //, a State has duties and obligations // unlike a group. We welcome France's historic decision // and we pay tribute to President MACRON // and to the leaders of many other countries, // who recognized last Monday, September 23, // "the State of Palestine", // from this UN platform. 4 We are delighted with this happy initiative, // which comes following the New York Declaration // adopted this same month of September // by this august General Assembly // and in line with that of the international conference // organized last August // by France and Saudi Arabia, // under the aegis of the United Nations. We call on this Assembly // to irreversibly place // the future of the Palestinian State // at the heart of our common agenda. It is our moral responsibility to act, // because each day that passes without action, // leads to the death of thousands of innocent people, // women and children. No one will be able to say anymore, // I didn't know. History is an implacable judge // which will forgive neither silence nor inaction. Madam President, Peace and development // cannot be built // without justice and inclusion. This is why, // 65 years after independence, // Africa, a continent of nearly two billion inhabitants, // must obtain its legitimate place within the Security Council // of the United Nations. The vision of the African Union // — a united, prosperous, peaceful Africa and actor of its destiny — // fully meets the spirit of this Session. During my presidency of the African Union, // I made conflict resolution and mediation // a priority, // in order to realize the ambition // of “silence the guns”. 5 This commitment is the key // to the effective implementation // of the African Continental Free Trade Area, // pillar of a strong Africa // in the concert of Nations. Madam President, In the same vein, // I would like to recall the 1971 resolution // declaring the Indian Ocean // a “zone of peace, free of nuclear weapons and military bases”. However, // even today, // contrary ambitions threaten this stability. I thus denounce // firmly // any plan to install a military naval base in Mayotte, // a Comorian island which remains, // unfortunately, // still under French administration. The Union of the Comoros, // which has just celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence // and its admission to the United Nations, // remains committed to the full recovery // of its national territory // — Anjouan, Grande-Comore, Mohéli and Mayotte. I would like to renew // the gratitude of the Comorian people and Government // to all those who, // on the occasion of this Fiftieth Anniversary, // sent us their congratulations and good wishes. In this context and from this rostrum, // I cannot ignore the question of Mayotte, // a Comorian island still under French occupation // despite the clear and repeated resolutions // of this Organization. The dialogue initiated with France // on what the late President Mitterrand // described as an unpleasant dispute // must succeed because // this dispute which has lasted too long, // costs the lives of thousands of our compatriots each year // in the arm of the sea separating Mayotte and the other sister islands. 6 This week again, // extremely serious facts // were revealed by an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde // which reports deliberate maneuvers // by the Police operating in Mayotte, // who regularly drive // ​​to sinking of boats // and which caused the death // of several Comorian nationals. Thus, // the Union of the Comoros calls on the French State, // occupying power // to stop these operations, // to initiate appropriate investigations // and to sanction the perpetrators of this barbarity, // so that justice is done // and so that the dignity of human lives is respected. For its part, the // Union of the Comoros will relentlessly pursue // its diplomatic and legal action // so that justice is done // and so that a just solution is found // to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte, // which constitutes one of the last wounds // of decolonization in Africa. We are therefore sorry, // that certain brother countries, // which have always defended international law and the Comorian cause, // are procrastinating today // and taking unfortunate initiatives with France, // to establish relations with Mayotte, // in defiance of our national sovereignty. We call on the African Union to act, // to recall the duty and necessity // of respect for international law // and the unity of our archipelago. Madam President, Like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), // Comoros is on the front line of climate change // and remains a vulnerable but determined country 7 Rising sea levels, // coastal erosion and the increased frequency of cyclones // threaten our villages, our ecosystems and our lives. We call for fair and simplified access // to climate finance // and increased solidarity, // so that our populations // can not only survive, // but thrive. In recent years, // the Union of the Comoros has initiated the Emerging Comoros Plan (PCE), // which aims to transform our economy, // strengthen our infrastructure, // modernize our education // and improve the health of our populations. We invite our // bi- and multilateral partners as well as the private sector // to join this forward-looking development project // based on three pillars //: inclusive growth, // energy and digital transition // the blue economy, which constitutes one of the riches // of the Indian Ocean Security in this region // depends on the stability of each of its States // and we thus condemn, // all forms terrorism and transnational crime. We plead for strong multilateralism, // just and united, // based on the Charter of the United Nations // and respect for the sovereign equality of States. We must reaffirm our commitment // to a more equitable world order, // where small states have a voice // and fully participate // in global governance. To stem the excesses of protectionism and withdrawal, // we are in favor // of reforms to the international financial architecture. 8 After the COVID -19 pandemic, // the climate crisis and the growing debt of developing countries, // it is imperative to adapt the global financial system // to economic, geopolitical and social realities. Fifty years after the proclamation of its independence, // the Comorian Nation is still young, // but strong in its experience and its dreams. The Comorian people, // proud of their history and confident in their future, // remain attached to this Assembly, // which embodies our common aspirations for peace, // justice and development // which must constantly be consolidated. I therefore solemnly call // on the international community and our development partners // to support our efforts, // as a guarantee of a world // truly at the service of peace, // development // and human rights. Thank you for your kind attention
