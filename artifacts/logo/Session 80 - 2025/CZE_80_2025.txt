Madame President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,  
I am humbled to speak here in front of you again. Today, I wish to address two main issues: 
UN’s achievements and necessity of its reform and prospect of multilateralism in the light 
Russian aggression.  
Eighty years ago, the United Nations was founded with great hope to prevent war and 
destruction – never to repeat the horrors of World War II.  
My country  proudly stood amongst  the founding nations, signing the Charter that would 
become  our collective moral compass.  
Since 1945, we have witnessed remarkable achievements. The United Nations helped to 
prevent another full -scale world conflict.  
It assisted the dissolution of colonialism and rise of new sovereign countries in Asia, Africa, 
Europe and Latin America.  
Together, we created a robust multilateral system of rules and global cooperation in 
international security, human rights and economic development.  
Together with the UN we have fought famine, disease, illiteracy and poverty in some of the 
world’s most vulnerable regions. Dozens of peacekeeping missions have helped to ease 
tensions in conflict zones.  
Thanks to its long -standing efforts, the UN has helped transform countless lives and laid the 
groundwork for a better world. A  world which is more humane and more cooperative.  
It provided a  platform where even the smallest nations can speak out and be heard.  
The UN remains the only institution where the world can collectively confront global crises.  
Not with weapons, but with dialogue, shared responsibility and pressure where necessary. 
UN’s greatest achievement is not perfection, but its persistence.  
 
With many devastating conflicts ongoing, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly 
transformed the global security landscape.  
Since the last General Debate a year ago, our world has not become more secure. On the 
contrary.  
In the game of smoke and mirrors, Russia continues targeting civilians, civilian infrastructure, 
foreign diplomatic missions and most recently, even our neighbouring country, Poland.  
Not to forget the acts of hybrid warfare on our own territory.  
These range from disinformation campaigns and attempts to undermine public trust to cyber -
attacks – and even acts of sabotage carried out by mercenaries recruited online.  
Despite being the largest country on the map, Russia still aims to seize Ukrainian territory and 
expand its sphere of influence.  
Backed by China, Iran, North Korea and other countries that help it circumvent sanctions and 
provide economic or political support.  
Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, not only violates the principles of 
state sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the UN Charter but also sets a 
dangerous example and precedent that aggression can yield territorial and pol itical gain.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Our multilateral system was created on the premise that rules apply to all without exception.  
The consequences of this war go far beyond the news headlines. This war threatens to 
dismantle our system of governance based on mutual respect, equal partnership and rules we 
all subscribed to.  
What is happening in Europe today could happen anywhere else tomorrow - under different 
circumstances, but under the exact same pretext. If Russia wins this unjust war, it will 
legitimise the triumph of brute force. Turning a blind eye to Ukraine today is a green light to 
any future aggressor, anywhere in the world.  
Disruptions of the status quo in the Taiwan Strait or elsewhere in the Indo -Pacific would 
further destabilize global security and trade. Geographical distance offers no protection – 
security in one part of the world is directly linked to security everywher e. 
Tolerating the principle of might makes right will lead to the end of multilateralism and the 
beginning of life under principles dictated by a powerful few.  
It would be a future with history deliberately rewritten, with lies promoted as facts and with 
truth slowly disappearing from our discourse and memory – just the opposite of what most of 
our nations fought for in the previous century.  
The heroism of Ukrainian people, their willingness to sacrifice for freedom, and global 
solidarity with Ukraine, demonstrate that most of us still believe in universal values - and in 
our responsibility to defend them.  
To achieve sustainable peace, we, democratic allies from all over the world, must act in unity 
and intensify our economic pressure on Russia. This is the only way to bring the aggressor to 
the negotiating table.  
Such peace - based on the existing international law, including territorial integrity and the 
right for self -determination - is in the interest of not only European countries, but of the whole 
international community.  
Any future peace agreement must send a clear message worldwide that aggressor cannot be 
rewarded and borders cannot be changed by force!  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
the structure of the UN was based on the outcome of the World War II.  
Today, one of the UN Security Council Permanent Members – Russia – is waging a ruthless 
war while obstructing any constructive solutions put forward.  
It is in light of these new geopolitical realities that we need a  strong and effective UN system 
capable of responding to today’s global challenges — from security threats and climate change 
to the rapid evolution of new technologies.  
Otherwise, we risk sliding into a world that is more fragmented and far less predictable.  
Czechia welcomes the UN 80 Initiative and the commitments in the Pact for Future. Yet these 
ambitions stand in stark contrast with today’s reality. In the light of Russian aggression 
against Ukraine, the UN Security Council is currently failing its purpose and mission.  
Therefore, we advocate for a comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council for greater 
effectiveness, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability with the aim to honour the 
principles of UN Charter and strengthen the voice of underrepresented regions.  
Freedom and human rights are not granted entitlements.  They are hard -won principles that 
must be cherished and protected.  
Security Council membership should not be seen as a matter of prestige or privilege, but above 
all responsibility to defend global peace.  
That’s why Czechia is seeking a non -permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the term 
2032 - 2033 with a clear commitment: to uphold the rules -based international order.  
We cannot afford to have the UN paralysed and blocked in its ability to respond to crises and 
challenges.  
Current urgent crises are already consuming too much of our attention and resources at the 
expense of other major, equally pressing issues.  
 
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen,  
As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the UN significantly improved the quality of 
life of billions, including through access to education, healthcare and services.  
In this year’s Sustainable development report, Czechia ranked 10th out of 167 countries. I am 
fortunate to be a citizen of a country which, by global standards offers a secure and 
comfortable life.  
This does not mean there are no challenges. Much work still lies ahead if we are to achieve the 
Sustainable Development Goals 2030 – both at home and globally.  
After all, most of the challenges we are facing are global. No single nation is powerful enough 
to succeed alone.  
That’s why we need more dialogue.  
That’s why we need greater cooperation and collective action.  
And ultimately, that’s why multilateralism must not only survive – it must thrive.  
Not only for us, but most importantly for future generations. Thank you.
