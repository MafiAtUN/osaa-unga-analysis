SPEECH BY PRESIDENT LUIS ABINADER CORONA AT THE 80TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS September 2025 Excellencies, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Honorable Heads of Delegation; Ladies and gentlemen, Eighty years ago, from the ashes of war, this Organization was born with the firm commitment to prevent humanity from sinking again into hatred and barbarism, and the conviction that cooperation and dialogue should govern our coexistence. In the Dominican Republic we are fully aware of our responsibility as a member nation of the international community and the impact that global decisions have on our societies. For this reason, we demand – with conviction – a more just international order where the development of some does not mean the sacrifice of others. We live in a moment of high international complexity, where five forces combine to profoundly shake up the destiny of our people: political polarization, the resurgence of trade protectionism, the technological revolution, climate change and geopolitical competition. These global challenges have very concrete consequences for countries like ours. Recent and persistent wars have generated disruptions in the markets, creating volatility and uncertainty in commodity prices. The recent tariffs introduce a new factor of unpredictability for international trade. Hurricanes and uncontrolled upwelling of sargassum remind us of our climate vulnerability. And misinformation, amplified in digital environments, erodes citizen trust. These are challenges that converge and test the principles of the San Francisco Charter. The key to assuming them was stated by Franklin Delano Roosevelt: “The true safeguard of peace can only be found in cooperation based on economic and social justice.” Against this backdrop, the Dominican Republic reaffirms its faith in the founding mandate of the United Nations Organization, in its principles and values, not as secondary options, but as the only ways to preserve peace and human dignity. We raise the motto that calls us together today: Better Together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights. We assume it as a historical mandate and legitimate cry of our people. Madam President, Multilateralism is going through profound challenges, aggravated by the financial crisis that affects this Organization and by the growing difficulty of reaching consensus to stop conflicts. In this context, we urgently need more frank, effective and results-oriented spaces for dialogue, at all levels. We must listen to each other with greater openness and genuine willingness to mutual understanding. If we do not transform the United Nations, we run the risk of it falling into irrelevance, and this would be a catastrophe that we must not allow. The UN80 initiative offers us a historic opportunity to revitalize mandates, renew structures and restore effectiveness and credibility to this common roof of nations. The Dominican Republic strongly supports this process. In the coming months, a new secretary general must be elected. It is now up to Latin America and the Caribbean to offer renewed leadership, with the vision, independence and commitment that the times demand. Our region has the diversity, capacity and experience to raise a strong voice for peace, climate justice, human rights and sustainable development. I am fully convinced that the time has come for a woman to occupy the General Secretary. Colleagues, Barely five years separate us from 2030, and the Sustainable Development Goals continue to lag behind. The main obstacle is an architecture international financial system that does not respond to the realities of developing countries. The commitments made during the recent Conference on Financing for Development in Seville are a positive step, but insufficient. We need a real transformation. A new international financial pact with access to concessional financing, debt relief, innovative mechanisms and greater technical cooperation. The Dominican commitment is solid. Despite the challenges, we have made tangible progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We highlight, in particular, the sustained progress in the first two SDGs: poverty reduction and zero hunger. As a result of our social protection policies, the promotion of agricultural production and the increase in the minimum wage, we managed to reduce moderate poverty from 25.8% in 2019 to 18.05% in the first quarter of 2025; and undernourishment decreased from 8.6% in 2018 to 3.6% in 2025. Ladies and gentlemen, With responsibility and consistency, I have maintained before this Assembly — and in all relevant international forums — that the multidimensional crisis in Haiti represents a serious threat to peace and security for the Dominican Republic and the region. Since 2021 we have clearly maintained: the only way out for Haiti is coherent and sustained international action, which guarantees minimum security conditions and opens the way to the broadest democratic and sovereign agreement among Haitians themselves. That neighboring country is currently experiencing an unprecedented human tragedy: extreme violence, institutional collapse and territorial control of numerous criminal gangs that terrorize the population. Groups that the Dominican and US governments have classified as terrorist organizations, and with which there can be no negotiation. Faced with this reality, the Dominican Republic has deployed a continuous diplomatic offensive with the aim of achieving an effective international response. In this vein, the Security Council approved a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS), along with an arms embargo and a sanctions regime for people and institutions that promote these criminal organizations. We appreciate the leadership of Kenya, Jamaica, Belize, Bahamas, Guatemala and El Salvador, and the financial support of the United States, Canada and other countries that have made the initial deployment possible. But the mission has not yet reached the necessary scale, number of troops and adequate financing, so it has not achieved its objectives. For this reason, we firmly support the draft resolution presented by Panama and the United States before the Security Council, based on the proposal of Secretary General Guterres, to transform the MSS into a force that manages to impose order and restore peace, with a reinforced command structure, clear and evaluable goals, and the logistical and operational support of an office under the command of the United Nations. This proposal establishes a more robust presence, with greater coordination, supervision and accountability standards, both in human rights and operational performance. We urgently call on the members of the Security Council, especially the permanent five, to adopt this resolution without delay. We must be aware that the mandate of the MSS expires on October 2, we are facing a delicate transition period that requires guaranteeing legitimacy to the entire current contingent of the mission. The Dominican Republic demands that this request be supported, and does so from the very frontier of the Haitian collapse. We also appeal to the political, financial and operational support of Latin America and the Caribbean for the mission in Haiti. This is a country in our region, which demands shared responsibility as neighbors. It is important to make clear that the Dominican Republic will continue to protect its territorial integrity and enforce its national immigration regime. No State It cannot be blamed for defending its borders or for guaranteeing the security of its citizens. We cannot and should not bear the weight of a crisis alone that overwhelms any national capacity. It is not sustainable, nor safe for anyone. Every day of inaction pushes away the solution to the crisis, let's act now! Friends, For Small Island Developing States, the triple planetary crisis – climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution – is an existential threat. This crisis in the Caribbean has a specific face: sargassum, a devastating phenomenon that affects our coasts, public health and livelihoods. We demand solidarity and climate justice, which translates into accessible financing, technology transfer and urgent actions to protect our oceans. The Dominican Republic is moving towards ratification of the BBNJ Treaty, convinced that the protection of marine biodiversity is a shared duty. The seas are a source of life, and taking care of them is taking care of our future. Distinguished delegates, This eightieth anniversary should not be a ritual of nostalgia, but rather a vibrant call to renew humanity's alliance with itself. Although we are not facing a world war, the world is bleeding on multiple fronts, and uncertainty spreads like a shadow. This is not the future that our ancestors dreamed of, nor the present that our people deserve. The UN cannot limit itself to recording crises: it must be a compass in the storm and a lighthouse in the night. We hope that faith in dialogue and consensus, in the power of multilateralism, in human dignity and in progress that excludes no one is not extinguished. Power without justice and progress without equity are mirages. The world cannot continue to be a plan drawn by a handful of architects, inhabited by millions of tenants. A world designed for a few would be a punishment; one designed by and for everyone, would be a horizon of shared prosperity. The Dominican Republic raises its voice to ignite hope and call for action. May peace not be a desire, but a decision of all. That is our cry. That's our dream. That must be our common pact. Thank you so much.
