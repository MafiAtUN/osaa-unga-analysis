Climate Change  
 
Madame President,  
 
The climate crisis is not up for debate; the only q uestion now is whether we as leaders will act 
with the urgency it demands. The landmark ICJ’s adv isory opinion reminds us that climate 
action is not only a moral imperative, but also a l egal one. It affirms that all states, particularly 
those who are Parties to the UNFCCC and Paris Agree ment, must do their fair share to limit 
warming to 1.5 degrees celsius and that major emitt ers carry the primary duty to act and keep 1.5 
alive. It also underscores the obligation of develo ped countries to support the adaptation efforts 
of countries like mine who live with the impacts of  climate change everyday. It confirms that not 
meeting these obligations can lead to legal consequ ences under international law. This points to 
the simple truth that at the core of this climate c risis lies the pursuit of justice – justice for the  
most vulnerable, justice for future generations and  justice for our shared planet. 
I call on the General Assembly to adopt a resolutio n endorsing the ICJ’s opinion, so that together 
we send an unmistakable signal that upholding clima te obligations under international law is the 
shared duty of all nations.  
Pacific Island Leaders have spoken with one voice i n our recent Pacific Islands Forum 
Communique: methane mitigation must be a global pri ority, and methane mitigation across all 
sectors must be a core objective of every country. Cutting methane now could prevent 0.3 
degrees celsius of warming by the 2040s, slowing oc ean heating and buying us time for long-
term decarbonization. This is the only scalable nea r-term solution that can protect vulnerable 
nations and peoples today, while we build the futur e of clean energy tomorrow.  
The COP30 will be the first opportunity since the I CJ’s advisory opinion for us to take ambitious 
and aggressive actions to put the world back on tra ck for 1.5 degrees. There is no time to waste.  
 
After three decades of COPs, and now with the clear est pronouncements by the ICJ, let’s get to 
work.  
 
Plastics 
 
Madame President,  
 
Micronesia remains committed to achieving an ambiti ous global agreement to end plastic 
pollution, including in the marine environment.  Mi cronesia actively participated in the 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) on Pl astic Pollution.  We are proud to have 
stood with over 100 countries making clear that the  pollution emitted from the full lifecycle of 
plastics requires a full lifecycle approach: to add ress all pollution from plastics, from the 
production and design stages all the way through to  waste management and remediation.  This 
pollution—including climate warming greenhouse gase s and thousands of other toxic 
chemicals—severely impacts our health, our environm ent and our economies.  Despite the 
failure of the INC to produce a plastics treaty in Geneva, we are not giving up.  The plastic 
pollution crisis is far too dire to ignore.

Ocean 
 
Madame President, 
 
The year 2025 is an important year for the Ocean. I n June this year, the UN Ocean Conference 
adopted the Nice Ocean Action Agenda , a forward-looking document to guide us all.  Also  as of 
today, there are 145 countries that have signed the  BBNJ Agreement and 70 that have ratified. 
With this development, the BBNJ Agreement will ente r into force in 4 months.  
 
Micronesia is also participating actively in the re lated and critical work of the International 
Seabed Authority (ISA).  Micronesia is following a precautionary approach to deep seabed 
mining.  We emphasize the necessity of consolidatin g comprehensive knowledge, data, and 
scientific understanding of the marine environment and the impacts of deep seabed mining 
before any exploitation takes place.  
 
Additionally, it is crucial that all stakeholders, including adjacent coastal states, Indigenous 
Peoples, and local communities in the Pacific, are consulted and their perspectives considered 
before any exploitation occurs. In Micronesia, we h ave taken steps in preparation for exploration 
and possible exploitation in a responsible manner. We urge the ISA to finalize without further 
delay all relevant regulations, standards, and guid elines for its Mining Code prior to any 
exploitation – as failure to do so risks countries turning to alternative measures.   
 
 
Finance 
 
Madame President, 
 
Small Island Developing States face unique and heig htened vulnerabilities to climate change, 
shaped by geography and scale. 
Disaster risk reduction and resilience strategies m ust reflect these realities. That is why the 
Multidimensional Vulnerability Index is so vital. I t recognizes our economic, environmental, and 
social fragilities. And it ensures that support ref lects genuine need, not just income levels. 
The MVI provides a fairer framework for allocating resources. Development partners must base 
its aid decisions on it, pairing it with traditiona l measures to better target climate and disaster 
support. 
Going forward, implementation demands three things:  adoption by international bodies, 
continuous technical refinement, and strong commitm ent from partners to align financial and 
policy support with the vulnerabilities the MVI rev eals. Only then can this tool deliver the 
resilience our small islands urgently need.

 Health  
 
Madame President, 
 
Micronesia continues to confront a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the 
persistence of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and rising mental health concerns. 
In response, we are reorienting our health systems around primary health care as the foundation 
for universal health coverage. We are investing in the rehabilitation of primary healthcare clinics, 
the development of our health workforce, and the us e of telehealth to extend essential services to 
our most vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. However, to realize the goal of universal 
health coverage, additional financial and technical  support from the international community is 
indispensable. 
Madame President, gender equality and social inclus ion are equally central to our development 
agenda. Our Strategic Development Plan places this at its core, with the objective of ensuring 
equal access to services, equitable participation, and opportunities for all our citizens to thrive. 
 
Commitment to Peace  
 
Madame President, 
 
Peace and unity are the foundation of our nation. O ur Constitution reminds us that we must “live 
together in peace and harmony, to preserve the heri tage of the past, and to protect the promise of 
the future.” 
Today, as conflicts continue to unfold across the w orld, we hold hope that they may be resolved 
through leadership rooted in peace. In our own regi on, while we uphold peace and unity as 
guiding values, we find ourselves navigating the ge opolitical and geostrategic competition 
among major powers. 
As Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, we recentl y adopted the Ocean of Peace Declaration at 
the 54th Annual Meeting in Honiara. In doing so, we  affirmed that no single Member State can 
face the growing threats to peace and security alon e. We must act together—as one Pacific 
family. 
 
Digitalization: AI & Cybersecurity  
 
Madame President, 
 
Micronesia co-sponsored the first-ever UN resolutio n on AI alongside 120 member states. While 
AI holds great promise for economic development, it  also carries risks that must be carefully 
managed. The inclusive and constructive dialogue th at shaped this resolution offers a model for 
future discussions, including those on peace, secur ity, and the responsible military use of AI. As 
the digital world advances at an unprecedented pace , global cooperation is essential to ensure 
that AI systems remain safe, secure, and trustworth y. Micronesia through our own cybersecurity 
efforts is committed to developing national strateg ies and policies to safeguard our digital data 
and mitigate the risks of malicious attacks.

 Food Security & State of Emergency  
 
Madame President,  
 
Food and water security remain pressing challenges for Micronesia, as fragile freshwater sources 
and climate extremes undermine agriculture, marine ecosystems, reduce yields of traditional 
crops and increase reliance on costly less nutritio us imports. Compounding these challenges, just 
days ago I was compelled to declare a national stat e of emergency due to an ongoing oil leak 
from a World War II sunken vessel in Chuuk Lagoon. This ship, together with more than 60 
other wartime wrecks, has rested in our waters for nearly 80 years since the war’s end. But now 
these remnants of conflict pose new dangers as toxi c oil seeps into our ocean, threatening our 
fisheries, coastal communities, and livelihoods. Th e scale of this crisis far exceeds Micronesia’s 
capacity to address alone. As we mark the 80th anni versary of the war’s end, we appeal to the 
international community to work with us in transfor ming this legacy of war into an opportunity 
for cooperation.  
 
Security Council Reform  
 
Madame President, 
 
Micronesia emphasizes the urgent need to address th e current structure of the United Nations 
Security Council, which fails to represent the geop olitical realities of the 21st century. The 
exclusive nature of its permanent membership create s inequities and hampers effective responses 
to global crises. To enhance legitimacy and account ability, we must restructure the Council to 
include underrepresented voices, including Japan, I ndia, Germany, Brazil and the African 
continent. Such reforms would better reflect modern  international dynamics and strengthen the 
Council's role in promoting peace and security. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Madame President, 
 
Eighty years ago, the United Nations was founded on  a simple but enduring truth: every nation—
big or small—has a voice, a vote, and a role to pla y in shaping the world we share. Micronesia 
may be small, but our voice, our vote and our place  within the international community is 
committed to choosing that we are in fact “Better T ogether”. That truth must guide us still. 
Because big or small, every nation has the power to  choose peace over conflict. Big or small, 
every nation has the duty to protect our planet fro m harm. Big or small, every nation has the 
responsibility to defend justice and human dignity.  Big or small - we always have been, and 
always will be, “Better Together”. 
 
I thank you.
