Madame President,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
It is an honour to address this Assembly at the start of its 80th session under your 
leadership, Madame President. Croatia co ngratulates you on your election, a step 
forward for gender equality. I also thank your predecessor for his dedicated service 
during the last session.  
 
Allow me also to commend the Secretary -General, His Excellency Mr. António 
Guterres, for his vision and commitment in steering the United Nations through 
turbulent times.  
 
For Croatia, the United Nations has always been a core, essential global institution. 
During our own struggle for independence, sovereignty, recognition, and territorial 
integrity, the Uni ted Nations played a decisive role. Our path to admission and 
early years of membership were about braving the stormy seas rather than smooth 
sailing – and it was this organisation and what it represents, the principles of the 
Charter of the United Nations  that served as our safe harbour. I believe this 
experience proved productive for both Croatia and the UN, and has provided many 
lessons for the future – including on how to successfully end a complex war and 
conduct peaceful territorial reintegration.

 Today, the international community faces daunting challenges.  
 
Armed conflicts are more numerous than at any time since the Second World War. 
They are multiplying and intensifying, overwhelming humanitarian systems and 
eroding trust in our capacity to prevent or resolve crises.  
 
In Ukraine, we hope the senseless loss of human lives will end as soon as possible. 
We welcome recent diplomatic efforts and encourage inclusive dialogue that can 
restore peace.  
 
Beyond Europe, other regions face devastating crises. In Gaza, tens of thousands of 
women and children have been killed. Millions live without safety, food, medicine, 
and basic human dignity. This is worse than a mere war - it is carnage and we 
urgently call for it to end, for safe delivery of aid —especially to children —and for 
the release of all hostages. Lasting peace can only come through the universal 
recognition of the legitimate political aspirations of the Palestinian people, long 
denied.  
 
The suffering in less visible crises is no less real. In Sudan, one  of the gravest 
humanitarian catastrophes of the 21st century is unfolding before our eyes.  
 
UN peacekeeping must adapt to today’s conflicts. Missions must be flexible, 
realistic, and sequenced toward achievable goals. This requires the Security 
Council t o focus on political solutions and remain committed to sustaining peace 
long after missions withdraw.

 Peace is more than silencing the guns. It requires preventing new wars and 
breaking the cycles of violence from the past. Lasting peace rests on democrac y, 
legitimate governance, and full respect for the right of each people to freely choose 
their leaders.  
 
Madame President,  
 
In our region of Southeast Europe, Croatia continues to champion and promote 
legitimate political processes as the foundation of pr ogress. EU membership is not 
a cure -all, but it remains a strong driver of prosperity, as can be witnessed in 
Croatia. We promote good neighbourly relations and urge all countries to refrain 
from actions that undermine stability in the region.  
 
In Bosnia a nd Herzegovina, we call for full respect of the constitutional order, 
sovereignty, and equality of the three constituent peoples. All parties, and the 
international community, must uphold the Dayton -Paris Peace Agreement.  
 
Respecting the right of constituen t peoples to choose their legitimate political 
representatives at all levels of government is fundamental prerequisite of lasting 
stability and progress.  
 
Madame President,  
 
Lasting peace cannot be imposed. It must be built. And if it is to be sustainable,  it 
must include respect for human rights and development that is inclusive and fair – 
basic building blocks of any just and prosperous society.

 The humanitarian system must be reformed to respond with speed, innovation, and 
stronger partnerships with loc al actors. Croatia supports the UN’s “Humanitarian 
Reset” in order to make responses more agile, effective, and grounded in resilience. 
Above all, strict respect for international humanitarian law must remain the moral 
core of multilateralism.  
 
In Croatia,  decades after the Homeland War, families still search for 1,744 missing 
loved ones. As co -chair of the Global Alliance for the Missing, Croatia draws on its 
painful experience to raise global visibility of this issue, share good practices, and 
strengthen cooperation.  Survivor -centred justice is enshrined in our laws, and we 
encourage others to follow this path.  
 
We also share the Croatian model for searching for the missing. It rests on effective 
interdepartmental cooperation and a comprehensive, transpare nt approach without 
discrimination, consistent with the highest international standards. With this in 
mind, Croatia is proud to host later today a high -level side event on missing 
persons in armed conflict, dedicated to advancing the search for answers.  
 
Another legacy of the Homeland War is the issue of landmines. Croatia has been 
active in promoting the Human Rights Council’s first resolution on landmines, 
adopted by consensus on April 4th, International Mine Action Day. The resolution 
reaffirms the treat y banning anti -personnel mines and sends a clear message: the 
needless cruelty of these weapons violates basic human rights.  
 
The togetherness which is promoted throughout this debate, especially means 
inclusion of the most vulnerable. Therefore, Croatia i s proud to have led the 
initiative resulting in consensus adoption and an impressive 99 Member States co -
5/11 
 
 sponsoring the General Assembly resolution declaring June 27th as the 
International Day of Deaf -blindness.  
 
Madame President,  
 
Peace and security a re inseparable from development and human rights. The 
founders of the United Nations acknowledged this when they placed these three 
pillars at the heart of the Organization.  
 
As we mark the 10th anniversary of the General Assembly’s resolution on the 2030 
Agenda, Croatia reaffirms its commitment to the SDGs and to ensuring that no one 
is left behind.  
 
We are grateful to Member States for their support in electing Croatia to the UN 
Economic and Social Council for the 2026 –2028 term. Our priorities will includ e 
accelerating the 2030 Agenda, preparing momentum for the 2027 SDG Summit and 
the agenda beyond 2030, and strengthening links between humanitarian, 
development, and peace efforts.  
 
At home, in Croatia, sustainable development is fully embedded in national  
planning. Croatia’s National Development Strategy 2030 is closely aligned with the 
SDGs, placing us among leading global performers.  
 
We reaffirm our commitment to progress made at COP meetings, including the 
landmark COP28 agreement to begin phasing ou t fossil fuels. COP29 in Baku must 
deliver a new quantified climate finance goal, and COP30 in Belém must raise 
6/11 
 
 ambition, advance fossil fuel transition, and scale up climate finance. Croatia 
supports a credible climate finance roadmap.  
 
The triple planeta ry crisis also threatens global public health. Croatia endorses the 
One Health approach, recognizing the interdependence of human, animal, and 
environmental health. We welcome adoption of the Pandemic Agreement at the 
78th World Health Assembly earlier thi s year.  
 
As a Mediterranean nation, Croatia knows that healthy seas are both a national 
imperative and a global responsibility. We remain committed to multilateral ocean 
protection under UNCLOS. We welcome the outcome of the 3rd UN Ocean 
Conference in Nice , have ratified the BBNJ Agreement, and urge others to do so 
quickly.  
 
Croatia’s contributions to development cooperation and humanitarian aid continue 
to grow. Since 2011, we have steadily increased our support, reaching record levels 
in 2023.  
 
We share lessons from our own recovery —from democratic transition to mine 
action and veteran reintegration. In Ukraine, our expertise in humanitarian 
demining is particularly valued, making us one of the leading contributors relative 
to GDP.  
 
Our support extends far  beyond our neighbourhood, reaching South -Eastern 
Europe, the Eastern and Southern neighbourhoods, and Africa.

 Madame President,  
 
Fundamental changes we are witnessing in our world are not mere historical echo, 
but an all -encompassing global transformatio n: we are at a defining moment of an 
era to come.  
 
Emerging technologies are reshaping every aspect of society —how we live, how 
we trade, and how we defend ourselves.  
 
Drones are a clear example. They did not only increase the lethality of war. They 
changed its economics. They showed us that assumptions we held only a decade 
ago about defense and deterrence are already outdated.  
 
This disruption brings danger, but also opportunity. New tools can be misused by 
hostile actors, spreading instability and lowering  the threshold for conflict. But the 
same tools, used responsibly, can strengthen our defenses, improve disaster 
response, and drive economic growth. Artificial intelligence, cyber capabilities, 
space technologies, robotics —each can be a threat, or a solut ion. 
 
The choice is ours. We need to rethink security, not only nationally, but globally. 
Rules, safeguards, and cooperation must keep pace with innovation. If they do not, 
we risk instability. But if they do, these technologies can become engines of 
resili ence and stability.  
 
The task is urgent. The world must act with clarity, not hesitation. Emerging 
technologies are not tomorrow’s challenge. They are today’s reality. And how we 
8/11 
 
 choose to guide them will define not just the future of defense, but the futu re of 
peace.  
 
Madame President,  
 
Reforming the United Nations is an existential necessity. At 80, the UN must adapt 
to stay relevant and effective. We welcome the Secretary -General’s UN80 initiative 
as an opportunity not only to celebrate achievements but also to reform and 
revitalize the Organization.  
 
Security Council reform remains essential. The Council must become more 
inclusive, effective, transparent, and accountable. Croatia supports comprehensive 
reform, including enlargement in both categories of membership and stronger 
representation of underrepresented regions, especially Africa.  
 
The financial stability of the UN is also vital. All Member States must pay their 
contributions in full, on time, and without conditions. Without predictable 
financing,  mandates fail and trust weakens.  
 
The upcoming Peacebuilding Architecture Review offers another chance to turn 
commitments into action. Croatia will contribute actively, emphasizing prevention, 
coherence, and stronger links between peace, development, and  human rights.  We 
welcome the decision to provide assessed contributions for the Peacebuilding Fund 
from 2025, but needs still outpace resources.  
 
 
 
9/11 
 
 Madame President,  
 
The UN does not exist for itself, but to serve humanity: to save and improve lives, 
prote ct dignity and freedoms, and advance peace, security, and sustainable 
development. On its 80th anniversary, we have a duty to leave to future generations 
a UN system that is stronger, not weaker.  
 
Croatia will continue to defend the principles of the Chart er and international law, 
to support multilateral solutions, and to build partnerships rooted in respect and 
responsibility.  
 
The world is not short of strategies, reports, or debates. What it lacks is political 
courage. Let us find that courage together —and prove that multilateralism can meet 
this moment and rise to the challenges of our time.  
 
Thank you.
