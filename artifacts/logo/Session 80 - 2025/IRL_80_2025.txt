National Statement by  Taoiseach , Mich eál Martin , T.D.,  
to the 80th Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly   
26th September 2025  
   
President of the General Assembly, 
distinguished Heads of State and Government, 
Secretary General, Excellencies, Friends . 
 
It is important to remember what brings us 
together every year.   
 
Eighty years ago, the world was emerging 
from  the most savage conflict in our history.   
 
2 
 
80 million people lay dead.   
 
A deliberate, industrial -scale genocide, aimed 
at obliterating Europe’s Jewish population, 
saw six million people murdered – a 
monstrous crime that remains unsurpassed in 
human history.   
 
People were targeted for death because of their 
ethnic identity, their sexual orientation, their 
disability.   
 
Cities were laid waste, throttled by siege, fire -
bombed into oblivion, or pulverised by the 
first and only use of atomic weapons in war.   
3 
 
Humanity had descended into the abyss.   
 
This United Nations was the phoenix that rose 
from that darkness , the highest expression of 
our commitment to unite our strength to 
maintain international peace and securit y. 
 
It was the best attempt by those who had seen 
the worst of humanity to offer a different path 
to future generations.   
 
 
 
4 
 
Dag Hammarskjold, UN Secretary General in 
the 1950s, captured the reality of that vision 
best when he stated:   
 
“The United Nations was not created to take 
mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from 
hell.”  
 
Since Ireland joined in 1955, the United 
Nations has been the cornerstone of our 
foreign policy.   
 
There is no Member State more committed to 
its ideals.   
 
5 
 
There is no Member State more determined to 
ensure it succeeds in its mission.   
 
Like all small Member States, w e depend on 
the UN Charter and the protections of 
international law for our security and well -
being.  
 
At a time when the world  risks slipping back 
into an order in which  might is right , and some 
voices count  more than others , it is up to us as 
Leaders to re assert and to insist on  the 
primacy of international cooperation.   
 
 
6 
 
Human Rights  
Madam  President  
 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
states that “ the recognition of the inherent 
dignity and  of the equal and inalienable rights 
of all members of the human family is the 
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the 
world .” 
 
I am deeply concerned by the constant 
pushback on human rights norms that has 
accelerated in recent years.  
 
7 
 
Against women’s rights and gender equality, 
against LGBTQ+ rights . 
 
I call out the brutal Taliban for their denial of 
the most fundamental rights of Afghanistan’s 
women and girls.  
 
Ireland continues to work tirelessly to oppose 
all attempts to dilute existing international 
commitments and  human rights  standards.  
 
We reaffirm our commitment to honour and 
comply with the universal nature and the 
individuality of human rights.  
 
8 
 
To demonstrate that commitment we will run 
for a seat on the Human Rights Council from 
2027 to 2029.  
 
Conflict and Peacekeeping  
President , 
 
Conflict is always and everywhere a sign of 
human failure.    
 
Conflict destroys lives.  
 
It devastates economic development.  
9 
 
It leaves scars and divisions that take 
generations to heal.    
 
We in Ireland know that from experience.   
 
On Friday of last week, the Irish and British 
Governments agreed a new framework for 
addressing the legacy of the conflict in 
Northern Ireland.  
 
The Good Friday Agreement would not have 
been possible without the support and 
engagement of the international community.  
 
10 
 
We are ready to o ffer the same to others.  
 
The Irish people are enormously proud of our 
67 years of continuous UN peacekeeping, 
especially our engagement with UNIFIL and 
close connection to Lebanon.   
 
We remember the members of our Defence 
Forces who paid the ultimate price.  
 
Continued support for UNIFIL will be 
essential over the next 15 months to support 
the efforts of the Lebanese authorities given 
the complexity and scale of challenges in the 
region.  
11 
 
Sudan  
Madam  President  
 
In Sudan, a grave humanitarian catastrophe is 
unfolding.    
It is more than two years since war broke out 
and it has unleashed the most unimaginable 
human suffering on the civilian population.    
 
More than 150,000 people are already dead.  
 
12 million people displaced.  
 
12 
 
Vicious sexual violence against women and 
children.  
 
Famine declared throughout the country.   
 
The world has failed Sudan.   
 
To our collective shame, we have not given 
this most destructive of wars the same focus 
and attention as conflict in other parts of the 
world.    
 
13 
 
But a child in Sudan has the same value, the 
same right to life and a peaceful childhood, as 
a child born anywhere else in the world.  
 
The conflict in Sudan is a human catastrophe 
that risks wider stability in the region.    
 
It must be stopped.   
 
Ireland fully supports the work of the 
Secretary General’s Personal Envoy for 
Sudan, Madam  Ramtane Lama Madam a, to 
achieve a negotiated ceasefire, an immediate 
humanitarian response and a durable peace.   
 
14 
 
The perpetrators of war crimes  in Sudan  must 
be held  to account .  
 
The jurisdiction of the International Criminal 
Court should be extended to all of Sudan.   
  
Ukraine   
 
Eighty years ago, Europe had more reason 
than most to say ‘never again’.   
 
Yet today brutal and bloody war has returned 
to European soil.   
 
15 
 
In February 2022, Russia - a founding member 
of United Nations and a permanent member of 
its Security Council - launched a full -scale , 
illegal invasion of Ukraine, in defiance of 
international law, in defiance of  the UN 
Charter.   
 
It has prosecuted the war with a wilful and 
reckless indifference to its human 
consequences.   
 
Tens of thousands of Ukrainians have been 
killed and maimed.   
 
16 
 
Millions have been forced to flee their 
homeland.  
 
Millions more internally displaced.   
 
Russia has deliberately and cynically targeted 
civilians and civilian infrastructure.  
 
It has caused immense environmental 
devastation.   
 
Cities such as Mariupol, Kharkiv and 
Bakhmut have been bombed  to rubble.    
 
17 
 
Prisoners have been mistreated.   
 
Children abducted.   
 
President Putin has thumbed his nose at every 
attempt to bring about a ceasefire and 
negotiations, including those led by President 
Trump.   
 
There are no signs whatsoever that he is ready 
for peace.   
 
He has refused to meet President Zelenskyy.  
  
18 
 
He has again intensified Russia’s attacks on 
civilians and civilian infrastructure in 
Ukraine.   
 
He has sought to test the resolve of Ukraine’s 
neighbours, sending drones into Polish and 
Romanian airspace.   
 
He should know that it will not work.   
 
He should appreciate how strong the people of 
Ukraine are, and how unbreakable their 
resolve to defend their country and its 
independence.   
 
19 
 
Those  of us proud to be part of the Coalition 
of the Willing in support of Ukraine will stand 
with them, shoulder -to-shoulder, for as long as 
it takes.   
 
If Russia chooses not to come to the table, the 
world must increase economic and political 
pressure on it until it does.   
 
With our EU and international partners, we 
will strengthen and tighten our sanctions.   
 
We will also work to increase support for 
Ukraine.   
 
20 
 
We will put in place the security guarantees 
that Ukraine needs to underpin any future 
peace agreement.   
 
Ireland strongly believes that Ukraine is part 
of the European family and that its future lies 
within the European Union.   
 
We will continue to work with our EU 
partners to ensure its journey  towards 
membership advances as quickly as possible.   
 
 
 
21 
 
Middle East   
President , 
 
I come now to Gaza, a catastrophe  of the most 
monumental and consequential kind.   
 
It is not possible to describe the scale of the 
physical and psychological suffering endured 
by the Palestinian people for t wo long and 
brutal years.   
 
Ireland stands in full solidarity with them.   
 
22 
 
We acknowledge those who have worked in 
the most unimaginably difficult circumstances 
to preserve and sustain life, to treat the 
injured, to prevent the displacement and 
destruction of a people and their rich and 
irreplaceable cultural heritage.   
 
At the heart of this vital effort have been UN 
agencies and workers, most especially 
UNWRA.  
 
We remember those among them who have 
lost their lives.   
 
23 
 
We pay tribute to the extraordinary bravery of 
the medics.   
We honour the journalists who have worked 
tirelessly and without regard to their own 
safety to ensure that nobody can ever say ‘we 
did not know’.   
 
What is happening in Gaza cannot be justified 
or defended.   
 
It is an affront to human dignity and decency.   
 
It is an abandonment of all norms, all 
international rules and law.   
24 
 
 
We are witnessing  hunger being used as an 
instrument of war.   
 
Babies starving to death while aid rots at the 
border.   
 
People shot while desperately seeking food for 
their families.   
 
The deliberate targeting and destruction of 
schools, hospitals, mosques, cultural 
institutions.    
 
25 
 
The killing of doctors, aid workers, 
journalists.   
 
Dislocation and displacement , over and over.  
 
We are all witnesses to the immense wrath of 
one of the world’s most modern and best -
equipped armies brought to bear on a trapped 
and defenceless civilian population.   
 
Last week the Independent International 
Commission on the Occupied Territories 
called it out for what it is.   
 
26 
 
Having examined carefully Israel’s conduct of 
the war since 2023, as well as the actions and 
statements of senior Israeli military and 
political figures, it concluded that Israel is 
responsible for the commission of genocide in 
Gaza.   
 
Genocide. The gravest of crimes in 
international law.   
 
All signatories of the Convention on Genocide 
are obliged to act to prevent and to punish it.   
 
We cannot say we were not aware.   
27 
 
In January of last year, the ICJ put all states on 
notice of the plausibility of the State of Israel 
committing genocide in its military operations 
in Gaza.   
 
And the Court has been clear, where States 
Parties are able to contribute to the prevention 
of genocide they are obliged to “ employ all 
means reasonably available to them so as to 
prevent genocide as far as possible ”.  
 
As Navi Pillar, chair of the Independent 
Commission said last week, “the prevention of 
genocide is not a matter of discretion of states. 
It is a legal and moral obligation, and it 
admits no delay” .  
28 
 
All members of this United Nations must 
reflect on what more they can do.   
 
I especially call on those who have influence 
to use it urgently to maximum effect .  
 
I call on those  who have provided – and who 
continue to provide – Israel with the means 
necessary to prosecute its war to reflect 
carefully on the implications of their actions 
and the consequences for the Palestinian 
people.   
 
There cannot be business as usual in the face 
of genocide.   
29 
 
As Navi Pillar has made clear, to do nothing is 
not neutrality, it is complicity.   
 
Ireland has intervened in  the South African 
case at the ICJ.   
 
We have recognised the State of Palestine.  
  
We are legislating against the import of goods 
from the Occupied Territories.  
 
 
 
30 
 
We will act to prevent those members of the 
Government of Israel who have been 
instrumental in fomenting the unfolding 
disaster in Gaza from entering our country.   
 
We will continue to work with like -minded 
partners across the world to bring this human 
catastrophe to an end.   
 
There must be an immediate  ceasefire, the 
release of all remaining hostages, and 
unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and 
workers to Gaza.   
 
31 
 
Those responsible for war crimes must be held 
accountable – there can be no impunity.   
 
We also need to hold to account those 
responsible for the attack on Israel of 7 
October 2023 – that too was a monstrous war 
crime.   
 
I appreciate  the profound and continuing 
impact the trauma has had on people in Israel.   
 
Hamas, not the Palestinian people, were 
responsible . Hamas must answer for its 
crimes.   
32 
 
Hamas can have no role in the future 
governance in Palestine.   
 
But no crime, however heinous, can justify 
genocide.   
 
We also need to recognise the crimes being 
perpetrated in the West Bank.   
 
The scale and pace of appropriation of 
Palestinian land by illegal Israeli settlers .  
 
The open backing this receives from the Israeli 
Government . 
33 
 
The harassment, imprisonment and abuse of 
the Palestinian population .  
 
The withholding of tax revenues from the 
Palestinian Authority .  
 
It must not be allowed to continue.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
34 
 
In its Advisory Opinion published in July 
2024, the ICJ was clear that all States are 
under an obligation not to recognise as legal 
the situation arising from the unlawful 
presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory , and not to render aid or 
assistance in maintaining the Palestinian 
Territory.   
 
The world knows that what drives this illegal 
activity is a determination to render the 
possibility of a two -state solution impossible.   
 
It must not succeed.   
35 
 
A two -state solution remains the only pros pect 
for a peaceful future in which the people of 
Israel and the people of Palestine can live in 
peace and security, side -by-side.  
 
I welcome the decision to recognise the State 
of Palestine taken by France, Belgium, the 
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia  and 
others .  
 
I commend France and Saudi Arabia for the 
leadership they are providing in working 
towards a political process that can deliver a 
just lasting peace and security in the region.   
 
36 
 
They have my full support.   
Conclusion   
President , 
 
As it marks its 80th anniversary, the United 
Nations has never been more necessary.    
 
Today ’s challenges  are ever more complex, 
and ever more interconnected.   
 
They cannot be solved by any country or 
region acting alone.   
 
37 
 
The threat to the future of our planet and the 
wonder  of its biodiversity.   
The need for development , leaving nobody 
behind.   
 
The health and well -being of our people.   
 
The protection of our shared cultural heritage, 
in all its magnificent  diversity.   
 
The stability of our economies and our ability 
to trade fairly.   
 
38 
 
The immense opportunit y of the digital 
revolution, but also the potential consequences 
for our shared humanity.   
The UN is not perfect, and it needs to reform 
to reflect a very different world – I pay warm 
tribute to the role that Antonio Guterres has 
played as Secretary General during his term in 
office in that regard.   
 
The UN continues to represent the best of 
humanity.   
 
If it falters it is not because it is no longer 
relevant, it is because we, as Leaders, have let 
it down.    
39 
 
 
 
Let this be remembered as a time when we 
reaffir med our commitment to multilateralism, 
to the rule of law, to a reformed United 
Nations fit for purpose and for the future.   
 
As we did in the Charter, let us seek to save 
this and future generations from war .  
 
Let us reaffirm our faith in fundamental 
human rights , the dignity and worth of each 
human person.   
 
40 
 
Let us work to establish conditions in which 
justice and respect for international law can be 
maintained .  
And, as we pledged in the Charter, let us never 
cease to promote social progress and better 
standards of life for all, i n ever larger 
freedom.   
 
Thank you.   
 
ENDS.
