 Madam  President, Excellencies,  
 
On behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica, I 
extend warm congratulations to you, M adam  President, on 
your election to preside over this landmark 80th session of the  
General Assembly. Your leadership comes at a pivotal 
momen t, and Jamaica pledges its full support as we 
navigate the critical challenges  of our time . 
 
I also wish to commend your predecessor and Secretary -
General  Guterres  for their steadfast commitment to 
multilateralism in changing  times .  
 
The UN at 80  
Just last week, Jamaica marked 63  years  as a proud member 
of the United Nations . As we celebrate  the UNs’ 80th 
anniversary, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the 
principles of the  UN Charter.  
 
From decolonization to peacekeeping, from eradicating 
diseases to promoting human rights, the UN has achieved 
remarkable successes  over the past eight decades .

 Yet, as we confront global challenges  including pandemics, 
climate change , armed conflict , and persistent poverty, we 
must acknowledge that our multilateral system requires 
urgent reform and revitali sation  to meet the needs of the 21st 
century.  
 
The UN80 Initiative  is an opportunity to strengthen 
multilateralism  with concrete action, institutional reform, and 
renewed political will. We must build a system that is more 
democratic, representative, and responsive to evolving  
challenges.   
 
Jamaica is honoured that o ur Permanent Representative is 
co-chair ing the Working Group on UN80  Mandate 
Implementation Review, along with the Permanent 
Representative of New Zealand, and we look forward to 
meaningful outcomes.

 Madam President,  
Jamaica believes in a future where multilateralism works for 
all, where no country is too small to be heard,  where the 
concerns of Small Islands facing rising seas are addressed, 
where the benefits of globali sation are e quitably shared , and 
where international cooperation is based on respect  for the 
sovereignty  of each nation .  
 
Climate Resilience  
Madam  President, Climate Change is not a distant threat . It 
is a daily  reality f or Small Island Developing States like 
Jamaica .  Frequent hurricanes, droughts, and erratic rainfall 
destroy  infrastructure,  displace communities, and set back 
decades of hard -won progress.  
 
Jamaica has demonstrated unwavering leadership in 
climate action despite our limited resources. We have 
committed to achieving net -zero emissions by 2050 and have 
implemented our National Adaptation Plan with specific 
measures to build resilience across ke y sectors  and we  are on 
track to achieve our renewable energy target of 50% by 
2030.

 However, our efforts, and those of other SIDS, are severely 
constrained by the lack of predictable and accessible 
finance. The promise of $100 billion annually remains 
unfulfilled. The Loss and Damage Fund established at COP28 
was historic, yet its initial capitali zation of $800 million is grossly 
inadequate. Developed countries must  hono ur their 
commitments and scale up climate finance, recogni sing that 
adaptation is a necessity for the survival of SIDS.  
 
International financial institutions must integrate climate risk 
into lending decisions and develop new financing 
instruments to address climate vulnerability. The Seville 
Commitment offers a roadmap for transforming the global 
financial architecture to support climate action and 
sustainable development.  
 
Financing for Development  
The global financing system remains fundamentally flawed. It 
penalises reforming economies like Jamaica with high 
borrowing costs while ignoring our vulnerabilities.  
 
Page 6 of 11 
 Through sacrifice, discipline, and sound management, 
Jamaica has reduced its debt -to-GDP ratio from 144% to now 
62%. Yet we remain locked out of concessional financing 
because of outdated metrics based solely on per -capita 
income.  
 
Jamaica supports the application of the Multidimensional 
Vulnerability Index that more accurate ly assess es countries' 
development needs and their eligibility for concessional 
financing.  
 
Jamaica also strongly supports innovative financing 
mechanisms, including debt -for-climate swaps, debt -for-
nature swaps, and blended finance instruments that can 
unlock private sector investment in sustainable development 
projects while reducing debt burdens. We welcom e 
initiatives such as the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust 
and call for its expansion to support more countries in building 
climate resilience.  
 
Cuba Embargo

 Madam President, multilateralism must deliver fairness for all. 
Jamaica continues to believe that constructive dialogue 
and engagement offer the best path forward for the people 
of Cuba to fully participate in the global economy. We 
encourage continued dom estic reform in Cuba and greater 
integration into international systems, supported by policies 
that enable progress rather than isolation.  
 
 
Situation in the Middle East  
Madam President,  
Jamaica once again condemns the heinous  October 7 , 2023 
attack on Israel and  deeply regrets the devastating 
humanitarian consequences of the co unter -offensive in the 
Palestinian territories.  A just and peaceful resolution to the 
conflict is only possible through diplomacy and dialogue .  
 
We continue to support United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 242 and support the call for a ceasefire 
agreement that includes the release of all remaining 
hostages  and definitively ends the protracted war and 
human suffering.

Haiti  
Madam President,  
Political instability, gang violence, and humanitarian crises  in 
Haiti , affect not only the Haitian people , but the entire  region . 
 
As current Chair of CARICOM, Jamaica has led and 
participated in efforts to restore peace and constitutional 
order  in Haiti . Last year, we welcomed, and participated in, 
the deployment of the Multinational Security Support Mission 
(MSS) to Haiti, and we  commend Kenya's leadership in this 
initiative.  
 
The security situation remains  dire. As we contemplate next 
steps, we urge Member States, especially those in the 
Security Council, to operationali se the recommendations 
made by the Secretary General for a transition to a more 
robust hybrid mechanism to deal with the situation in Haiti.  
We call on Member States to provide the necessary financial 
and logistical support to ensure the success of this initiative.  
The cost of d oing nothing would be unthinkable .

 But security operations alone will not suffice. Haiti’s 
governance deficits and fragile institutional framework must 
be addressed. Once stability is restored, the international 
community must help rebuild democratic institutions, ensure 
free and fair elect ions, expand humanitarian relief, and invest 
in infrastructure to support long -term stability.   Haiti’s recovery 
requires sustained global support.  
 
Transnational crime  
Madam President,  
The Haitian crisis has laid bare a wider truth: transnational 
criminal networks trafficking arms, narcotics, and people are 
existential threats to states ; organizing violence,  and 
destabilizing institutions . Gangs are now global syndicates 
with resources that rival Nation States.  
 
Jamaica has made significant progress  in tackling gangs and 
reducing our homicide rate by more than 50% in recent 
years. But we know that unless these networks are  totally  
dismantled, our gains remain fragile. This is why we call for 
nothing less than a Global War on Gangs —a coordinated 
Page 10 of 11 
 international campaign to cut off the flow of weapons, 
money, and influence that sustain them.  
 
This requires deeper engagement from all Member States. 
We urge full implementation of the UN Programme of Action 
on Small Arms and Light Weapons and the International 
Tracing Instrument. Major arms -exporting countries must 
tighten export controls, strengt hen end -use monitoring, and 
ensure rigorous post -delivery verification.  
 
Equally, Member States in our region and beyond must 
commit to intelligence sharing, joint operations, and 
technical assistance for law enforcement, border security, 
and port control.  
 
 
The Caribbean has created regional security mechanisms , 
but these efforts alone cannot match the scale of the threat. 
What is needed is a united front, with the same urgency, 
resources, and coordination the world has applied to 
terrorism. Only then can we turn the Caribbean —and indeed 
the wider region —into a true Zone of Peace .

Conclusion  
Madam President,  
At this 80th session, let us revitalise multilateralism and 
recommit to building a more resilient, equitable, and 
sustainable world. The challenges before us — climate 
change, debt, poverty, conflict, and crime — are 
formidable. But our capacity for collective action is greater . 
Jamaica has shown that with sound policies, fiscal discipline, 
and good governance, small nations can achieve great 
progress. But to build on this progress, we need an 
international system that is fair, inclusive, and responsive.  
 
The world is watching us. Future generations are counting on 
us. And History will judge us.  
Let us not leave this Assembly with words alone, but with 
commitments that deliver real change.  
 
Jamaica stands ready to work with all Member States in 
partnership and solidarity to create a future defined by 
peace, prosperity, and dignity for all.  
Thank you, Madam President.
