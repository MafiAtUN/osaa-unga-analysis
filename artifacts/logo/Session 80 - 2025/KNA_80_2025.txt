 Madam President, Secretary -General António Guterres, Excellencies, distinguished 
delegates, friends of conscience and colleagues in the cause of civilisation — and to 
my fellow Kittitians and Nevisians at home and across the seas: I bring you greetings 
from our twin -island Federation, and I bring you a plea that must no longer be 
deferred.  
 
GLOBAL DIPLOMACY  
Madam President, for eighty years this Assembly has been a harbour for hope. From 
these benches ideas were born that banished hunger, cured children of disease and 
stitched torn treaties back together. We have reason to honour what has been 
achieved: right s extended, ladders out of poverty raised, medicines and measures 
moved across borders. Yet alongside those triumphs are truths we must not hide: 
partial pledges, procrastination and the persistent practice of putting profit before 
people. Where progress h as been made, too often it has been piecemeal; where 
promises have been given, too often they have been broken . 
 
We meet now at a moment of moral measure. The map of human destiny is not 
drawn merely by the large or the loud but by the just and the judicious. Diplomacy 
that is polite , but passive , is not enough. Language must be matched by labour; 
pledges must be partnered by payment  and rhetoric must be redeemed by results. St. 
Kitts and Nevis stands ready to work, to partner and to perform — but we ask of the 
great actors in this global drama a simple thing: and that is to transform  your capacity 
into compassion. Change the calculus of comfort for the calculus of climate justice.

 CLIMATE CHANGE  
Madam President, we are a people who measure time not by years alone but by 
storms. Imagine an elder fisherman, hands like weathered rope, watching the reef 
that used to cradle his nets die away until there is nothing left to catch but memories. 
Imagine schoolrooms without roofs and homes without running water. These are not 
metaphors for us; these are our fears at the turn of every hurricane season.  
 
The climate science is stern and the signs are severe. Heat that hangs like a heavy 
blanket smothers harvests and hardens the soil. Seas that swell swallow beaches 
where families once played cricket in the sand; storms that arrive more often, that 
intensif y in hours from category one to five, arrive with total fury and leave 
devastation in their wake. When a single hurricane can steal years of a nation’s GDP 
in a single night, the ledger of Gross National Income becomes a misleading measure 
of wellbeing.  
 
This is the anatomy of an injustice: the emissions that warm the planet are poured 
by the many into an atmosphere owned by no one — and paid for most dearly by the 
few, by our large ocean states. What was forged by centuries of industrial 
development now r eturns as tempest and trial to those least responsible. That is not 
merely an accident of geography — it is a failure of stewardship, a moral failing we 
must name and a responsibility we must repair.   
 
We therefore welcome the ICJ’s landmark ruling on the responsibility of states for 
climate change , and which makes clear that under international law, States have a 
binding duty to protect our planet from the escalating climate crisis.  We must do 
Page 4 of 14 
 better! We must cut emissions deeply and quickly, scale finance fairly and urgently, 
and equip vulnerable nations with the tools to survive and to thrive.  
 
I am also pleased to inform that on August 29, 2025 St. Kitts and Nevis ratified the 
Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty.  This is a 
historic achievement for the ocean and for multilateralism.  
 
SUSTAINABLE ISLAND STATE AGENDA (SISA)  
Madam President, Saint Kitts and Nevis has chosen to script a different future for 
survival and growth — one that speaks of balance, of care, and of durability. We 
have launched the Sustainable Island State Agenda — SISA — a deliberate blueprint 
that sets our course to 2040. SISA is not a slogan; it is a structured mechanism that 
places people at the  centre of progress and entwines sustainability with prosperity. 
It is guided by seven pillars — Energy Transition, Water Security, Food and 
Nutrition Security, Sustainable Industries, Sustainable Settlements, Circular 
Economy, and Health and Social Protec tion — each pillar reinforcing the others like 
ribs holding up the body of a nation that intends to continue standing strong.   
 
Our path under SISA is both practical and poetic. We are reimagining energy so that 
the power that lights our homes does not darken another nation’s future. We are 
investing in water as a right, not a luxury — drilling wells, restoring reservoirs, and 
integrating desalination powered by the sun so that a child need not learn to ration. 
We are reworking food systems , so farmers can feed nations, not just our markets. 
We are building homes that will shelter hope in the time of storm; hospitals that will 
heal in the time of shock  and schools that will kindle the skills to continue economic 
Page 5 of 14 
 diversification . These are not abstract ambitions. They are concrete commitments — 
a 70,000 -gallon -per-day solar desalination plant already commissioned and a two -
million -gallon desalination plant  nearing completion;  geothermal drilling in Nevis 
supported by multilateral finance to power both of our islands and beyond ; an 
ambitious Smart Homes programme; the JNF Smart Hospital initiative — all 
expressions of how a small nation answers a large challenge.  
 
We are taking bold, tangible actions that demonstrate how sustainability can be sewn 
into the simplest seams of daily life. The SISA vision mobilises resources, aligns 
ministries, elevates visibility, and —most importantly —invites society into shared 
respon sibility. It is an audacious plan because audacity is required of small states 
when the storm approaches.  
 
GENDER EQUALITY AND WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT  
Madam President, distinguished colleagues, just last week this Assembly took a vital 
step forward when the United Nations adopted, by consensus, a progressive 
resolution that revitalises the Commission on the Status of Women. Saint Kitts and 
Nevis was hono ured to co -facilitate this resolution alongside Ireland — a natural 
partner for equity, sustainability, and resilience. Saint Kitts and Nevis has made the 
empowerment, protection and upliftment of women and girls a cornerstone of our 
national agenda. Today , our Parliament boasts the highest number of female 
members in our nation’s history and it is led — proudly — by a woman Speaker of 
the House. This is not symbolic; it is structural. It is proof that when women lead, 
nations rise. Our Sustainable Island S tate Agenda is deeply rooted in gender equality. 
By empowering women and girls, we are not only advancing fairness; we are 
Page 6 of 14 
 reinforcing resilience. For we know this truth: when women are given the tools to 
thrive; families flourish, communities strengthen and nations become unshakable.  
 
ADOPTION OF THE MVI SHOWS WHAT’S POSSIBLE WHEN WE 
WORK TOGETHER  
The adoption of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index is a pivotal turning point. 
The MVI centres vulnerability — not just income — as the criterion for concessional 
financing. For countries like ours, which may register as "high -income" on the basis 
of statistical averages yet can be economically annihilated by a single climatic event, 
this change is life -saving. Where GDP is a static snapshot, the MVI is a living lens 
— it sees susceptibility, it weighs shocks, it measures exposure.  
 
The MVI can unlock concessional finance for resilience, transform loans into 
lifelines, and ensure that the reality of risk is not lost in translation. Let us now move 
from recognition to realisation — from the adoption of the MVI to its full 
institutionalisation across the World Bank, across the IMF, across regional 
development banks; let us bake vulnerability into the architecture of global finance 
so that resilience is not  the exception but the expectation.  
 
REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE 
AND BRIDGETOWN INITIATIVE  
Distinguished colleagues , talk of reform must not be timid. The architecture of 
international finance was largely built in a different century for a different world. 
That architecture must be remodelled so that it reflects the realities of today: climate 
Page 7 of 14 
 risk, transnational inequality, and the asymmetric impacts that fall upon the smallest 
and most exposed.  
 
Saint Kitts and Nevis  affirms its  staunch  support for the  Bridgetown Initiative and 
with our region’s  clarion call for financial and climate justice. The Bridgetown 
Initiative offers a practical, principled platform to alter debt dynamics, to reposition 
credit flows toward green investments, and to operationalise liquidity instruments 
that protect the vul nerable. We ask this Assembly and our global partners to help 
convert initiative into instrument  and to shift rhetoric into reflowing capital for 
resilience. The mission of the United Nations — peace, development and human 
rights — is not advanced by prese rving an architecture that perpetuates fragility. 
Reform is justice; reform is prudence; reform is protection  and equity . 
 
AFRICA AND THE CARIBBEAN  
I want to acknowledge the deep significance of the recent Africa -CARICOM 
Summit, a historic convening that rekindles bonds severed by the brutality of the 
Trans -Atlantic Slave Trade and colonization. This diplomatic meet was a profound 
moment of remembrance, resistance, and reconnection. We gathered as  descendants 
of a common ancestry, forging a shared agenda for reparatory justice, trade, 
transport , investment, sustainability, peace and security, climate action and technical 
cooperation. Our partnership sounds loud, not only a call for financial redress, but 
for justice. Reparatory justice is not just about giving money, it is about correcting a 
moral wrong.  
 
Page 8 of 14 
 For centuries, our ancestors were forced to work, beaten to work, dehumanized to 
work for free. Yet when emancipation came, it was not the enslaved who received 
reparations, but their enslavers. This moral inversion must be corrected.  As part of 
this broader historical reckoning, I also amplify the call for the full exoneration of 
Marcus Mosiah Garvey, a global Black icon, Pan -Africanist, and prophet of 
liberation. While we welcome the posthumous pardon granted to him , we continue 
to petition for his full e xoneration.  Let us correct this error in the record of justice.  
 
Today, we stand not in anger, but in resolve. As Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, 
“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” With our African 
brothers and sisters, as a nation and a region, we will continue to bend that arc toward 
justice, toward cohesion, and toward a future shaped not by the chains of history, 
but by the power of solidarity.  
 
 
SUSTAINABLE ZONES OF PEACE AND SECURITY  
There is a phrase I hold dear: peace is not the absence of noise; peace is the presence 
of safety. For those of us in the Caribbean, peace is a practical prerequisite for 
prosperity. Our zone of peace must be more than a slogan pasted on policy papers. 
It must be defended by concrete measures: better public health frameworks, stronger 
interdiction of illicit weapons, greater cooperation on maritime security, investment 
in community safety and youth employment programmes, and international support 
for capacity building in policing and justice systems.  
 
Page 9 of 14 
 We recognise the serious threats posed by drug trafficking and other transnational 
crimes . These  scourges must be addressed through cooperation, dialogue, respect for 
sovereignty and the full respect for the principles  of inter national law . Therefore, we 
continue to call for measures that encourage p eace, stability a nd mutual respect . 
These  are the only foundations on which lasting security and sustainable 
development can be built  and maintained  in our Hemisphere. Historically, in our 
region, disputes have been resolved through dialogue. As such, we encourage 
dialogue  between  our two friends  — the Bolivarian  Republic  of Venezuela  and the 
United States of America — to ensure  that our region remains a zone of peace.  
 
We are not asking for pity  or imposition . We are asking for partnership — for tools 
to block the flow of guns and the flow of funds that fuel violence; for initiatives that 
create opportunities so that young men and women find purpose in productive work 
rather than perilous pursuits. Partnership, not pity; prevention, not punishment.  
 
And yet, Madam President, partnership alone is not enough. The time has come to 
reshape the United Nations itself — to reform its structures so that they reflect the 
realities of our modern world. The Security Council — the very body charged with  
maintaining international peace and security — cannot be credible if it excludes 
representation from the region's  most vulnerable to the threats of our time: Africa, 
Latin America  and Small Island Developing States  — such as those in our Caribbean.  
To secure a world of peace, those who suffer the sharpest edges of insecurity must 
have a seat at the table where peace is forged.   
 
Across the globe conflict continues to wreak havoc — Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo , Yemen  — and each theatre of violence is a theatre 
Page 10 of 14 
 of human cost: children displaced, parents bereft, infrastructure destroyed. The 
pathway to peace is hard and long, but there is no ethical alternative to persistent and 
constructive diplomacy, to  humanitarian corridors that put people above politics  and 
the courage and will of leaders to  commit to a worl d rooted in peace , justice and 
compassion . St. Kitts  and Nevis calls for an end to the anguish caused by the horrific 
genocide that is unfolding in Gaza. We categorically condemn this affront to 
humanity , for which there must be acco untability. We urge  for an immediate and 
unconditional ceasefire , for the protection of civilians, for the release of hostages, 
and for the restoration of basic necessities and humanitarian access. International 
law, conscience and human decency demand no less.  Further, t he path to lasting 
peace between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, one that guarantees 
human rights, dignity, and security for all, lies in the implementation of a two-state 
solution . 
 
HAITI  
Madam President, distinguished delegates, our region remains incomplete while 
Haiti suffers. Haiti’s struggle is our shame if we do not respond with resolve. The 
people of Haiti carry within them an extraordinary history of emancipation and 
courage. Yet that history has been marred by instability, natural disaster s and foreign 
interventions that have too often deepened dependency and deprivation  rather than 
delivered dignity.  
 
Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Caribbean Community welcome the commitments of 
partner states — notably the Kenya -led Multinational Security Support mission and 
the backing of the OAS and other regional actors — to help restore security and to 
assist in rebu ilding Haitian institutions. But security is only the first step. We must 
Page 11 of 14 
 invest in Haiti’s health, education, agriculture, infrastructure and governance. We 
must help rebuild markets so that merchants trade rather than flee, we must help 
rebuild schools so that children learn rather than languish, we must help rebuild 
hospitals  so that mothers are treated rather than traumatised. Haiti must be allowed 
to write and lead its own restoration story — and the international community must 
be a steadfast partner , not a scriptwriter.  
 
CUBA  
The economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba is a relic that 
continues to wound an entire people and weaken regional solidarity. Year after year 
this Assembly has affirmed that the embargo is gravely unjust. Saint Kitts and Nevis 
joins the C aribbean Community in calling for its end and for Cuba’s removal from 
the List of State Sponsors of Terrorism, which isolates it from commerce and 
cooperation.  
Cuba ha sido desde hace mucho tiempo amiga del Caribe. Sus médicos y educadores 
han estado entre los socios más generosos de la región. Nuestra asociación continua 
con Cuba siempre estará firmemente cimentada en el respeto a los derechos humanos 
y a los de rechos laborales, en plena conformidad con el derecho internacional.   
Una Cuba más fuerte y sostenible no solo mejora el bienestar de sus propios 
ciudadanos, sino también la seguridad y sostenibilidad de toda la cuenca del  Caribe. 
Cuando las islas comparten tormentas, debemos compartir soluciones. Las sanciones 
no salvan vidas; la solidaridad sí.  
 
English: Cuba has long been a friend to the Caribbean. Cuba’s doctors and educators 
have been among the region’s most generous partners. Our continued partnership 
Page 12 of 14 
 with Cuba will always be uncompromisingly grounded in respect for human rights 
and labour rights, in full alignment with international law. A stronger, more 
sustainable Cuba enhances not only the well -being of its own citizens but the 
security and sustainability of the entire Caribbean basin. When islands share storms, 
we must share solutions. Sanctions do not save lives; solidarity does.  
 
TAIWAN  
The theme of this Eightieth Session, “Better together,” asks us to imagine a world in 
which inclusion is operationalised. Excluding Taiwan from agencies where it can 
and must contribute — such as the World Health Organization and the International 
Civil Aviation Organization — undermines global capacity for collective problem 
solving. Taiwan’s contributions in public health, technology and disaster response 
are not partisan; th ey are practical. To keep a door closed on cooperation in these 
domains is to take a risk the world cannot afford.  
 
Excellencies,  the Taiwan Strait is not merely a lane on a map; it is a lifeline of 
commerce and human connection. We must urge calm, counsel conversation, and 
choose the diplomacy of dialogue over the dramatics of discord. Trade, travel, and 
talks are how we protect the liv elihoods of ordinary people — whether in Taipei, 
Tallinn, or the twin islands of our Federation.  
 
TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE, THE UNSEEN MAJORITY  
I speak also to young people — those whose futures will be most shaped by what 
we do here. Your anger at injustice is justified; your impatience is prophetic. We 
need your innovation, your indignation and your insistence on better governance. 
Page 13 of 14 
 Give us your ideas and we will give you the institutions to implement them. 
Education must be practical and futuristic: training in renewable technologies, 
digital skills, sustainable agriculture. The ASPIRE programme  — Achieving 
Success through Personal Investment, Resources, and Education , our national effort 
to invest in children’s futures, is an example of how we seed hope at the roots.   
 
CONCLUSION  
Distinguished colleagues, when we accept the verse that says “we shall overcome,” 
we must pair it with the refrain “we shall act.” The triumph of the twentieth century 
was not inevitable; it was the product of people who chose courage over comfort. 
The triumph of this century will be no less possible, if we choose it.  
 
This Assembly has the capacity to imbue policy with compassion, to turn knowledge 
into kindness, to render solidarity not as sentiment but as system.  Let us be architects 
of a world where smallness is not a sentence but a strength; where islands  like ours 
are recognised as laboratories of resilience rather than limit cases of neglect; where 
being “better together” means binding ourselves in common cause, common finance 
and common care.  
 
May we be brave enough to act, willing enough to partner and wise enough to ensure 
that when future generations ask what we did at this turning point, their answer will 
not be “they hesitated,” but “they acted and acted together .” 
 
Thank you.
