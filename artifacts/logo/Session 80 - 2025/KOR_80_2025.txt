 Address by His Excellency Lee Jae Myung  
President of the Republic of Korea  
General Debat e 
80th Session of the UN General Assembly  
September 23, 2025  
 
(Check against delivery)  
 
I would like to express my respect and gratitude to all Members of the United 
Nations and staff of the UN Secretariat for their contribution to world peace and 
shared prosperity.  
 
I extend my sincere congratulations to Her Excellency Annalena Baerbock on 
assuming the Presidency of the 80th Session of the UN General Assembly. I also 
pay tribute to Secretary -General António Guterres for his unwavering 
dedication and hard work.  
 
I hope the 80th Session of the UN General Assembly will achieve even more 
meaningful results under their outstanding leadership.  
 
Madam President, Mr. Secretary -General, and distinguished delegates,  
 
This year is a meaningful year marking the 80th anniversary of the founding of 
the United Nations.  
 
The past 80 years of the UN have been a valuable journey of protecting the 
dignity and values of humanity and seeking a path forward for future 
2 
 generations.  
 
If someone asks what the UN has achieved, I would confidently reply, “Look at 
the 80 -year history of the Republic of Korea.”  
 
It is no exaggeration to say that the Republic of Korea’s history, dotted with 
challenges and responses, is the history of the United Nations, which has 
constantly confronted enormous challenges facing humanity.  
 
Liberated from colonial rule the very year that the United Nations was founded, 
the Republic of Korea emerged from the scars of division and ashes of war 
through UN assistance, maintaining national identity while achieving 
industrialization and blooming in to a democracy.  
 
Therefore, the Republic of Korea, in itself, is a country that has proven the 
value of the UN’s existence.  
 
Whenever the Republic of Korea revived the hopes of lives as precious as the 
weight of the universe amidst horrific wars and disasters, the UN flag fluttered 
at the center of that intense solidarity.  
 
The United Nations has  strived to provide equal rights and opportunities to 
everyone without discrimination and has provided education and vaccines to 
make children’s lives blossom.  
 
This small country in the East, which rose with the support of the UN and the 
international community, has become a proud UN Member that is drawing the 
3 
 world’s attention. It is raising its role and responsibility as a member of the 
international community more rapidly than any other country.  
 
There were times when democracy and peace were in crisis, but each time, the 
Republic of Korea rose with indomitable strength.  
 
Even a self -coup could not break the people of the Republic of Korea’s strong 
will desiring democracy and peace.  
 
“The Revolution of Light” that the people of the Republic of Korea achieved 
against the darkness of the insurrection last winter was a historic moment that 
demonstrated the brilliant achievement of the UN spirit.  
 
The remarkable resilience and strength of democracy that the Republic of Korea 
has shown will be ours as well as that of the entire world.  
 
“I need you to take my hand and guide me away from all this. Away to where 
the light shines through, to where the flowers bloom.”  
 
As the novelist Han Kang, laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature, wrote, the 
Republic of Korea will be a milestone of light for all who join the journey 
toward democracy.  
 
Today, at the UN General Assembly, where world peace and humanity’s shared 
prosperity is discussed, I proudly announce that a new Republic of Korea, 
which will be a beacon of light for global citizens, has completely returned to 
the international community .

 The Republic of Korea, which has grown thanks to the support and assistance of 
the UN, will not hesitate to take on the role of a leading nation, generously 
sharing its experience and history of restoring democracy.  
 
Despite ceaseless efforts from all corners of the world, the international 
community’s determination and aspiration to maintain international peace and 
security 80 years ago still remains an unfinished task for everyone.  
 
280 million people are still in a state of extreme hunger. Armed conflicts around 
the world, including in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as the climate 
crisis, which has already become a real problem, threaten the survival of 
humanity.  
 
The answer lies in the wisdom of the pioneers who founded the United Nations, 
as well as the path that the people of the Republic of Korea demonstrated. There 
is only one way: “more democracy.”  
 
“The People -Centered Government” of the Republic of Korea, through the 
power of collective intelligence, is ceaselessly attempting innovations seeking 
better alternatives in democracy.  
 
The way to solve common challenges facing the international community is no 
different. When all the countries experiencing the same problems gather here at 
the United Nations and continue multilateral cooperation putting their heads 
together, we will all be  able to move toward a bright future of peace and 
prosperity.  
 
I look forward to the “UN80 Initiative,” presented by the Secretary -General, 
5 
 taking root as a vision that achieves UN’s evolution and advancement in line 
with the demands of our time.  
 
I also hope the UN Security Council can increase the number of seats of non -
permanent members, reflecting changes in the international environment, and 
enhance its effectiveness and representation.  
 
As a member of the UN Security Council for the term 2024 -2025, the Republic 
of Korea is making efforts so that the UN Security Council can respond 
proactively to threats to the international peace and security.  
 
Madam President, Mr. Secretary -General, and distinguished delegates,  
 
The Republic of Korea, having restored democracy, dreams of a better future.  
 
The Republic of Korea will fulfill its responsibility as a responsible global 
power that steadfastly upholds the values of freedom, human rights, 
inclusiveness and solidarity championed by the United Nations.  
 
We will further develop our institutions and culture so that everyone residing in 
the Republic of Korea, both nationals and foreigners, can be respected as an 
equal member of society in all fields of life.  
 
The Republic of Korea will strengthen and lead cooperation with the 
international community while realizing the value of respect for human rights.

 In a time of crisis where immediate survival is urgent, words like solidarity, 
coexistence and cooperation may feel somewhat distant.  
 
However, humanity has always dreamed of hopes as high as its deep despair and 
has achieved the progress we see today through a passion for a “better 
tomorrow.”  
 
The more difficult the times are, the more we must return to the basic spirit of 
the UN, which is trust in universal values of humankind.  
 
Just as the determination to not pass down the devastation of wars led to the 
founding of the UN and has prevented conflicts and preserved peace, we, today, 
must cooperate more, trust more, and join hands more firmly in order to build a 
better world for fu ture generations.   
 
Democratic Korea will lead the way in multilateral cooperation toward a 
sustainable future.  
 
Peace is a value that is more important than anything else. In the Republic of 
Korea as well as everywhere in the world, peace is the basic foundation for 
democracy and economic development.  
 
The disputes and conflicts we are currently facing vividly show how easily the 
ideals of human dignity and sustainable development can crumble without 
peace.  
 
Today, the Republic of Korea is fulfilling its responsibility as a key contributor 
to the United Nation’s peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities.  
7 
  
Our brave soldiers who have steadfastly defended the Republic of Korea, a 
divided nation, are helping to pave the way toward sustainable peace led by the 
UN. 
 
Threats to peace are not only physical elements. In an era where artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology is critical to security capabilities and cyberattacks 
threaten national security, we must confront not only “visible enemies,” but also 
“invisible enem ies.” 
 
If we passively let ourselves be dragged along by the changes of the AI era, we 
will meet a dystopia of deepening polarization and inequality, unable to shake 
off the dark shadows of human rights abuses caused by the misuse of 
technology.  
 
However, if we proactively respond to these changes, we can use the high 
productivity as a driving force to build a foundation for innovation and 
prosperity, and create a useful base for strengthening direct democracy.  
 
I hope the Open Debate that I will preside over as UN Security Council 
President tomorrow will significantly contribute to the international 
community’s efforts to promote the responsible use of AI.  
 
Furthermore, we intend to share our vision for the future of AI through the 
“APEC AI Initiative” at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, which will be 
held in Gyeongju, Korea, next month.  
 
We will strive to ensure that the vision of “AI for all,” where advances in 
8 
 cutting -edge technology contribute to the universal values of humanity, 
becomes the “new normal” for the international community.  
 
AI-driven technological innovations will be an important new tool for solving 
global challenges like the climate crisis.  
 
Over the past 80 years, the United Nations has paved the way for sustainable 
development and spearheaded efforts to address climate crisis threatening the 
survival of humanity. Nations around the world must respond to these efforts.  
 
The Republic of Korea is pursuing a “great energy transition,” leveraging 
science and technology and digital innovation to increase energy efficiency and 
expand the share of renewable energy.  
 
We will submit a responsible nationally determined contribution within this 
year, joining the united will of the international community.  
 
At the “4th UN Ocean Conference” that will be co -hosted by the Republic of 
Korea and Chile in 2028, we will also work to build substantive solidarity for 
the sustainable development of oceans.  
 
Such efforts by the Republic of Korea to actively address global challenges are 
based on a firm commitment to fulfilling humanity’s shared promise of 
sustainable development.  
 
Since the United Nations established  the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) 10 years ago, the international community has made much progress in 
eradicating poverty and reducing inequality.

However, the demand for development financing is continuously increasing, 
and the most vulnerable are still suffering.  
 
Let us squarely face this grave reality and create new momentum for change. 
We must move toward structurally reforming global development governance 
while enhancing the quality of financial resources.  
 
I trust that we will pull together in order to bring about more cases like the 
Republic of Korea, growing and developing from an aid recipient country to an 
aid donor country.  
 
This year marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations as 
well as the 80th anniversary of the division of the Korean Peninsula. New 
challenges as well as unresolved tasks await us.  
 
Democratic Korea will begin a new journey toward peaceful coexistence and 
shared growth on the Korean Peninsula.  
 
The first step will be to restore broken inter -Korean trust and shift to a stance of 
mutual respect.  
 
The Government of the Republic of Korea clearly reaffirms that it respects the 
North’s current system, that it will not pursue any form of unification by 
absorption, and that it has no intention of engaging in hostile acts.  
 
Based on these three principles, we intend to end the vicious cycle of 
10 
 unnecessary inter-Korean military tension and hostile acts.  
 
That is the reason why we have proactively taken measures including halting 
the launch of leaflets and suspending broadcasts toward the North.  
 
Going forward, the Government of the Republic of Korea will consistently seek 
a path to reduce military tensions and restore inter -Korean trust  
 
The most certain peace is a state where there is no need to fight.  
 
Through comprehensive dialogue centered on “Exchange,” “Normalization,” 
and “Denuclearization,” in other words, “END,” we must end the era of 
hostility and confrontation on the Korean Peninsula and usher in a new era of 
peaceful coexistence and shared growt h. 
 
The fact that exchanges and cooperation are a shortcut to peace is a timeless 
lesson demonstrated by the history of fraught inter -Korean relations.  
 
By gradually expanding inter -Korean exchanges and cooperation, we will pave 
the way for sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula.  
 
It is crucial for both the ROK and the DPRK, as well as the international 
community to work together to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula.  
 
While striving to advance inter -Korean relations, we will provide our active 
support and cooperation for efforts to normalize relations with the international 
community including between the United States and the DPRK.  
 
11 
 Denuclearization is undoubtedly a grave task, but it is time to seek realistic and 
rational solutions based on a cool -headed perception that denuclearization 
cannot be achieved in the short term.  
 
The international community must gather its wisdom in a pragmatic and phased 
solution beginning with a “stop” in the sophistication of nuclear and missile 
capabilities, going through a “reduction” process and reaching “dismantlement.”  
 
Realizing lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula would present new hope and 
possibility to humanity suffering from conflict.  
 
The Republic of Korea will end the Cold War on the Korean Peninsula through 
the “E.N.D. Initiative” and fulfill its responsibility and role to contribute to 
world peace and prosperity.  
 
A future where people from different nations cooperate and overcome global 
challenges together may sound like a rosy, dream -like vision.  
 
However, this is by no means an impossible dream.  
 
Peace is not merely the absence of armed conflict, but the realization of a 
community where differences are respected and people coexist.  
 
As long as respect and aspiration  for diversity is inside us, we can always unite 
and embrace one another.  
 
K-culture is connecting people all over the world beyond borders, language and 
12 
 cultural differences.  
 
The success and spread of K -culture prove that universal empathy is possible, 
transcending differences in all backgrounds.  
 
Gathering the energy of solidarity, coexistence and consideration, the Republic 
of Korea, having ushered in a new democratic republic, is ready to move toward 
a sustainable future and a new page in human history.  
 
Though a difficult journey is expected, humanity has been able to grow and 
come this far by not giving up on challenges even in the face of adversity.  
 
As the people of the Republic of Korea raised colorful cheering sticks in the 
face of a crisis in democracy, I call on the international community and the 
United Nations to lift the lantern of hope that will light the future of humanity.  
 
The Republic of Korea will boldly lead the way toward a new era of “peaceful 
coexistence and shared growth” on the Korean Peninsula, toward a “better 
future together.”  
 
Thank you for your attention.
