STATEMENT  BY 
THE  HONOURABLE  ALVA  R. BAPTISTE  
MINISTER  FOR  EXTERNAL  AFFAIRS,  INTERNATIONAL  TRADE,  CIVIL  AVIATION  AND  
DIASPORA  AFFAIRS  
 
TO THE  GENERAL  DEBATE  OF THE   
80th SESSION  OF THE  UNITED  NATIONS  GENERAL  ASSEMBLY  
 
NEW  YORK  
MONDAY , 29th  SEPTEMBER,  2025

 Madame  President,  in the words  of the late Abraham  Lincoln:  the 16th President  of the United  States  
of America:  “The most  reliable  way  to predict  the future  is to create  it.” The words  of the late 
President  are illuminated  by R. Buckminster  Fuller  who  said and I quote:  “You  never  change  things  
by fighting  the existing  reality.  To change  something,  build  a new model  that makes  the existing  
model  obsolete” . 
Hence,  Madame  President  the theme  for this 80th Session  of the United  Nations:  “Better  together:  80 
years  and more  for peace,  development  and human  rights”  is a trumpet  call to like-minded  
countries  to urgently  reconstruct  a better  future  for humanity.   
"Building  that better  future  together"  emphasizes  the importance  of international  cooperation  and 
shared  responsibility;  which  requires  a framework  defining  a shared  destiny,  and that involves  
better  coordination  and coherence  across  different  actors  to deliver  the most  effective  and 
sustainable  responses.   
In this regard  Madame  President,  Saint  Lucia,  as a small  island  developing  state,  has maintained  its 
engagement  in the various  processes  of critical  importance  to its domestic  agenda  at the United  
Nations:  such  as climate  change  and sustainable  development , financing  for development,  
international  ocean  governance,  the proliferation  of small  arms  and light  weapons,  revitalization  of 
the General  Assembly  and decolonization.  These  all have  a real impact  on our national  plans  and 
programmes.   
In the context  of our development  challenges  the global  economy  is facing  multiple  shocks  that are 
threatening  to further  retard  and reverse  progress  on Saint  Lucia’s  Sustainable  Development.   
The impact  of these  compounding  shocks  is aggravated  by an unfair  global  financial  system  that is 
short -term  oriented  and crisis -prone,  which  further  exacerbates  inequalities;  not to mention  that 
Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS),  like Saint  Lucia  face existential  threats  amplified  by climate  
change.  Despite  some  skeptics,  there  is no doubt  that Climate  Change  is the most  consequential  and 
formidable  challenge  facing  SIDS.  In fact,  the latest  scientific  projections  portend  a grim  future.     
Consequently,  addressing  the climate  crisis  is imperative  for the survival  and well-being  of 
humanity,  transcending  national  borders  regardless  of size or wealth.  Prioritizing  climate  action  is 
not just an environmental  issue  but a moral  obligation  to protect  human  life, uphold  global  stability,  
and ensure  a sustainable  and equitable  future  for all of humanity.  The recent  advisory  opinion  from  
the International  Court  of Justice  (ICJ),  which  was requested  by this General  Assembly,  now  also 
frames  climate  action  as a legal  responsibility.  
Hence,  there  is an urgent  need  to accelerate  global  momentum  towards  the ambitious  targets  across  
various  international  agreements  and development  agendas.  A common  thread  across  these  
instruments  is the need  to address  the unique  vulnerabilities  and speci al circumstances  of Small  
Island  Developing  States  (SIDS).   
 
 Madame  President,  we also work  in the UN context  to strengthen  relations  with  countries  and 
regions  and encourage  cooperation,  while  remaining  staunch  advocates  of the principles  enshrined  
in the UN Charter,  the rule of law and the process  of multilaterali sm.  
And  Saint  Lucia  agrees  with  the UN Secretary  General  that:  “Multilateralism  is not an option  but a 
necessity  as we build  back  a better  world  with  more  equality  and resilience,  and a more  sustainable  
world."  for we are confronted  with  challenges  and threats  largely  emanating  from  the unilateral  
actions  of powerful  developed  countries;  and it is through  the multilateral  system  of the United  
Nations  that we can find comfort  and the support  to meet  these  challenges.    
However,  the erosion  of global  trust,  intensified  by geopolitical  divisions,  economic  disparities,  and 
ongoing  crises,  threatens  international  cooperation  and stability.  As nations  prioritize  self-interest  
over  collective  well-being,  diplomatic  relations  weaken,  and multilateral  efforts  falter.   
Madame  President,  while  global  solidarity  is essential  to uphold  human  rights  it is also important  
to support  self-determination,  especially  for marginalized  and colonized  nations.  Recognizing  their 
right  to independence  fosters  justice,  equality,  and dign ity; and builds  inclusive,  sovereign  societies,  
that reinforce  the universal  principle  that all peoples  deserve  freedom  and self-governance.  
It is for this reason  Madame  President  that the world  must  act to bring  an end to the gruesome  
carnage  and injustices  being  perpetrated  in Gaza  on the Palestinian  people  and this must  start  with 
the implementation  of the scores  of resolutions  that have  been passed  by the UN since  1947,  which  
call for the Palestinians  to exercise  their  right  to self-determination.  
Madame  President,  I draw  attention  in particular  to Resolution  3236  of 1974,  which  reaffirmed  the 
unassailable  rights  of the Palestinian  people  to self-determination,  national  independence  and 
sovereignty,  and the right  of the Palestinians  to return  to their homes  and property.    
In Saint  Lucia’s  reaffirmation  of its commitment  to human  dignity,  equality  and justice  Madame  
President,  the ongoing  Israeli  military  operations  in Gaza  and the West  Bank  raise  serious  concerns  
about  the humanitarian  impact  on innocent  civilians,  which  has exceeded  disturbing,  alarming  and 
unacceptable  parameters.  
Madame  President,  dropping  bombs  on civilians  – defenseless  men,  women  and children  – cannot  
constitute  a defense  of oneself.  Using  starvation  as a method  of so-called  warfare  cannot  constitute  
defense  of oneself.  Madame  President,  the destruction  of hospi tals, schools  and places  of worship  
in Palestine,  in no way  constitute  self-defense  and,  are completely  unacceptable,  inhumane  and 
atrocious.   
Because  Madame  President,  based  on publicly  available  data  from  United  Nations  agencies;  at least 
66,053  Palestinians  have  been  killed  – 65,062  in Gaza  and 991 in the West  Bank,  and of the identified  
fatalities  at least  18,430  are children.  Further,  at least 247 journalists  and 540 humanitarian  aid 
workers  have  been  killed  since  October  7th 2023.    
 
 Madame  President,  in this morbid  scenario  we must  remind  ourselves  that this is not a video  game;  
this is not science  fiction  and Palestinians  are not imaginary  people.  They  are human  beings  
deserving  of our collective  respect,  independence  and protection.  
Recognizing  the fact of the shared  humanity  of both  Israelis  and Palestinians,  should  cause  us to 
value  equally  the life of an Israeli  and the life of a Palestinian,  this would  lead naturally  to the 
fostering  of dialogue  and peaceful  solutions  to ensure  security  and stability  for all parties  involved.  
Because  respecting  human  rights  and protecting  all civilian  lives  must  remain  at the forefront  of 
international  efforts  to resolve  the conflict  constructively.      
Madame  President,  Saint  Lucia’s  position  is abundantly  clear;  that there  is an urgent  need  to put an 
end to the intolerable  and significant  human  suffering,  civilian  casualties  and widespread  
destruction.    
Hence,  Saint  Lucia  joins  with  the majority  of Member  States  which  continue  to call for de-escalation,  
dialogue,  and adherence  to international  law to prevent  further  loss of life and foster  a sustainable  
path  toward  peace.  
The Palestinians  must  have  their  own  state  and full membership  to the United  Nations  alongside  
the State  of Israel.   The only  way  for Israel  to have  secure  borders  is for the Palestinian  people  to live 
in their  own  internationally  recognised  homeland,  in accordance  with  the universal  right  to self-
determination.   
Peace  in the Middle  East can only  come  from  this, not from  bombs,  and wars,  and terrorism  and 
genocide  and illegal  settlements.  
Madame  President,  I speak  to you as one who  is conscious  of how  the transatlantic  slave  trade  
inflicted  unimaginable  suffering,  dehumanization,  and economic  exploitation  upon  millions  of 
Africans.    
This is why  we are adamant  about  our just cause  for Reparations  from  Europe  for the African  slave  
trade,  which  are, a moral  imperative  rooted  in justice  and acknowledgment  of profound  historical  
injustices  that have  long -lasting  consequences.  Unsurprisingl y, Saint  Lucia  will sustain  its 
condemnation  of the atrocities  being  committed  against  the Palestinian  people  – rooted  in centuries  
of oppression  -- including  the systemic  undermining  of Palestinian  statehood.      
Madame  President,  since  1992,  the United  Nations  General  Assembly  has consistently  and 
overwhelmingly  voted  for the removal  of the economic  sanctions  imposed  by the United  States  on 
Cuba.  It is time  for all to respect  and uphold  the will of the General  Assembly.   
Madame  President,  Saint  Lucia  has consistently  called  for an end to the US embargo  on Cuba  and 
its removal  from  the list of state  sponsors  of terrorism  because  such  measures  hinder  regional  
progress  and stability.  Engaging  Cuba  diplomatically  rather  than  isolating  it would  unlock  
 
 opportunities  to foster  regional  cooperation  – critical  for long -term  peace  and development  in the 
Caribbean,  as well as to create  an improved  security  architecture  for the entire  hemisphere.   
This pragmatic  approach  aligns  with  global  efforts  to promote  sovereignty,  respect,  and mutual  
understanding,  demonstrating  that diplomacy  and constructive  dialogue  are more  effective  
strategies  than  unilateral  sanctions.   
Madame  President,  ending  Russia's  war in Ukraine  is essential  to restoring  peace,  respecting  
sovereignty,  and preventing  further  humanitarian  catastrophe.  The ongoing  conflict  has caused  
immense  loss of life, displacement  of millions,  and widespread  destru ction,  destabilizing  the region  
and threatening  global  security.   
Hence,  ceasing  hostilities  would  demonstrate  respect  for international  law and sovereignty,  
encouraging  negotiations  over  continued  violence.   
Madame  President,  renewing  our commitment  to multilateralism  also means  that member  states  
must  take measures  to reduce  tensions  and settle  disputes  in areas  where  if not checked,  conflict  and 
war would  prevail.  It is for this reason  that Saint  Lucia  renew s calls  for the United  Nations  to allow  
Taiwan  to meaningfully  participate  in the UN system.  And  I state  categorically,  Madame  President,  
that UN resolution  2758  of 1971  does  not preclude  Taiwan’s  inclusion  and participation  in the United  
Nations  system.     
Madame  President,  Haiti  faces  an unprecedented  humanitarian  crisis  marked  by political  instability,  
widespread  poverty,  environmental  degradation,  and a fragile  healthcare  system;  all compounded  
by intractable  gang  violence.  Hence,  the urgent  need  for international  support  is critical  to prevent  
further  deterioration  of living  conditions,  protect  vulnerable  populations,  and restore  law and order  
as well as basic  services  like education  and healthcare.    
Without  immediate  action,  Haiti  risks  spiraling  into deeper  chaos,  increased  violence,  and prolonged  
suffering  that will destabilize  the region  and undermine  global  efforts  for stability  and development.   
This is why  Saint  Lucia  is extremely  concerned  that the multinational  security  support  mission  is 
woefully  short  of the personnel  and equipment  it needs  to effectively  pursue  its mandate.  Of the 
$900  million  the UN anticipated  raising  for Haiti,  only  9.2%  of this has been  received.  The UN 
Secretary  General  has best described  this: “as shamefully  overlo oked  and woefully  underfunded”.  
Madame  President,  on the 29 January  2014  the leaders  of the community  of Latin  America  and 
Caribbean  states  (CELAC)  declared  this region  as a zone  of peace;  it was a declaration  based  on a 
commitment  to upholding  the principles  of the UN Charter;  it was based on the understanding  that 
peace  was necessary  for the development  of the peoples  of the region  and that peace  in the region  
contributed  to international  peace  and security.   
 
 
 As recently  as 13th  June  this year,  at the Brazil  - Caribbean  Summit  in Brasília,  the Heads  of 
Government  reaffirmed  their  commitment  to maintaining  the region  as a Zone  of Peace.  It is in this 
context  therefore,  that Saint  Lucia,  like other  CARICOM  Member  States  views  with  concern  recent  
developments  in the region,  which  have  aggravated  tensions  between  Venezuela  and the United  
States.  We pray  that this tension  does  not degenerate  into violence;  hence,  maintaining  our region  
as a zone  of peace.  
It is also in the context  of the Latin  American  and Caribbean  region  as a Zone  of Peace  that Saint  
Lucia  is concerned  over  developments  between  Venezuela  and the CARICOM  member  state  of 
Guyana  in relation  to the border  dispute  between  the two countries.  Saint Lucia  urges  the non-use 
of force  on that issue  and reliance  on the multilateral  mechanisms  that are in place  for resolving  it.  
Saint  Lucia  prioritizes  diplomacy  over  violence,  believing  dialogue  fosters  peaceful  coexistence,  and 
safeguards  sovereignty.  Small  nations  like ours  can advocate  effectively  through  non-violent  
diplomacy,  demonstrating  its moral  and pragmatic  strength.    
Consequently,  we have  a moral  obligation  to promote  peace,  development,  and human  rights  
through  collective  leadership  rooted  in respect,  diplomacy,  and multilateral  cooperation.  
However,  Madame  President,  we have  to accept  that the UN’s  core mission  is being  ignored  and 
disrespected  when  we witness  the undeniable  genocide  that is being  committed  against  the people  
of Palestine,  especially  in Gaza.  Growing  famine,  widespread  starva tion and malnutrition  are 
contributing  to the carnage.   
In the words  of the UN Secretary -General,  Palestinians  in Gaza  are “enduring  a human  catastrophe  
of epic proportions”.  Further,  the recent  attacks  on Iran,  Syria,  Lebanon  and Qatar  speak  to a 
violation  of the UN Charter,  which  has now  become  normalized.   
We cannot  deny  that the UN’s  core mission  is being  snubbed  and disregarded,  when  after  three  
years,  Russia  continues  to flout  international  law and the UN Charter  with  its unprovoked  invasion  
of Ukraine.   
We have  to concede  that the UN’s  core mission  is being  disparaged  and treated  with  utter  contempt  
in the sixty -three -year -old unproductive,  unjust  and illegal  economic  embargo  that has been  
imposed  on the Government  and people  of Cuba  despite  the many  UN resolutions  calling  for its 
removal.  
And  we have  to agree  that the UN’s  core mission  is being  disregarded  in the conflict  in the Sudan.  
These  shocks  to the UN’s  core mission  should  be of concern  to all member  states;  but they  are of 
particular  concern  to all small  island  developing  states  (SIDS)  like Saint  Lucia,  not just because  these  
conflicts  threaten  world  peace  in general  but because  they  are symptomatic  of a departure  from  
multilateralism  and the adoption  of the outdated  notion  that might  is right.   
 
 Clearly,  Madame  President,  violence  is not in consonance  with  the requirements  of our times.   In 
fact it is abundantly  clear  that military  dominance,  which  is an expired  currency  of a bygone  era; is 
not moral  tender  and cannot  purchase  peace  and stability  in the contemporary  global  political  
environment.   
• The Old military  order,  though  fraught  with  contradictions,  is pregnant  with  renewal;  
without  guidance,  its offspring  may  be disfigured  by conflict,  but with  diplomacy  as the 
midwife,  this troubled  gestation  can deliver  a new  era of peace  and stability.  
• The World’s  intolerance  for the carnage  in Gaza  and the West  Bank  is symptomatic  of its 
resentment  for needless  bloodshed;  
• While  military  superiority  enables  death  and destruction,  it cannot  resolve  the spectrum  of 
challenges  that we, as a global  family,  are called  upon  to confront,  within  the framework  of 
our integrated  whole.   
Madame  President,  the UN80  Initiative  is essential  to revitalize  the UN’s  effectiveness  amid  crises,  
enhancing  multilateralism  to restore  trust  and address  issues  like climate  change  and inequality.   
Madame  President,  despite  challenges  like limited  enforcement,  vetoes,  and geopolitical  interests,  
the UN remains  a valuable  conflict  resolution  tool.  We should  leverage  the UN to advance  economic  
and social  priorities  and a stronger  international  response  to global  issues.   
Hence,  a new  model  for the United  Nations  should  prioritize  reforming  its decision -making  
processes  to enhance  efficiency,  accountability,  and inclusivity,  addressing  current  limitations  like 
veto  power  and bureaucratic  inertia.   
This model  would  shift  towards  a more  equitable  representation,  empowering  developing  nations  
and marginalized  groups,  ensuring  their  voices  influence  global  solutions.  It would  strengthen  the 
UN’s  capacity  for rapid  response  to crises,  integrating  innovat ive approaches  like technology  and 
multi -stakeholder  partnerships.   
By fostering  transparency  and accountability,  this new  model  would  rebuild  global  trust,  making  
the UN a more  effective,  responsive,  and equitable  platform  for advancing  peace,  sustainable  
development,  and human  rights  in an increasingly  interconnected  world. 
This model  will give birth  to an international  environment  of peace,  of the absence  of major  conflicts  
and wars,  of the decline  of unilateralism,  of a greater  functioning  multilateralism  that protects  us 
from  climate  change  and climate  injustice,  from  the scourge  of illegal  weapons  smuggled  into our 
countries,  an international  environment  where  nations  honour  their  financial  commitments  and 
responsibilities,  and respect  and promote  human  rights,  that supports  our efforts  at regional  
integration.  
 
 Madame  President,  this model  would  be a fine testament  that after  eighty  years,  multilateralism  
would  be in a good  place  and that with  the United  Nations  we can expect  that in the years  ahead,  
there  will be more  peace,  greater  development  and the prevalenc e of human  rights.  
Let us choose  it! Let us reach  for it! 
Because  afterall,  in the words  of R. Buckminster  Fuller:  “We are called  to be architects  of the future,  not its 
victims”.  Madame  President,  I thank  you
