STATEMENT  
by 
THE RIGHT  HONOURABLE  THE PRIME  
MINISTER  
MR. SAMUEL  NTSOKOANE MATEKANE  
 
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho  
 
  
During the 80th Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly (UNGA)  
 
 
New York , 
 
26th September , 2025

Madam President of the 80th Session of the 
General Assembly,  
 
Your Excellencies, Head s of State and 
Government,  
 
Mr. Secretary General of the United Nations,  
 
I extend heartfelt congratulations to You,  Madam 
President, on your election as President of the 
80th Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly.  
 
Your assumption of this esteemed office, as the 
fifth woman since the founding of the United 
Nations eighty (80) years ago, stands as a 
powerful affirmation of Member States’ enduring 
commitment to the principle of gender equality 
3 
 and women empowerment which are the 
essential pillars of the United Nations.  
 
As one of your Vice Presidents, my delegation 
pledges its full support and cooperation to 
ensure a successful and impactful tenure of 
office as the President  of the 80th Session of the 
General Assembly.  
 
We also take this opportunity to commend your 
predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Philemon 
Yang, for his distinguished leadership during the 
79th Session. Africa takes pride in his exemplary 
service and the values he brought to the global 
stage.  
 
To the Secretary -General, Mr. António Guterres, 
we express our profound appreciation for your 
unwavering dedication to the multilateral system  
and to the service of humanity, particularly in 
4 
 these challenging times underpinned by rising 
global tensions and trade wars.  
 
Notwithstanding these self -less contributions , 
we remain deeply concerned by the budgetary 
constraints facing our organization which derail 
the work of the organization and the attainment 
of its goals.   
 
The ongoing volatility in global trade and the 
unilateral protectionist measures including the 
selective adherence to the principles enshrined 
in the Charter of the UN  constitute the main 
challenges to  the multilateral system .  
 
In addition, t he apparent disregard of the United 
Nations General Assembly decisions by some of 
the powerful members undermines the credibility 
and effectiveness of the United Nations.   
 
5 
 All these challenges require our collective and 
concerted efforts to achieve the objectives of the 
UN. 
 
Madam President,  
I wish to inform this august Assembly that, since 
2014, the Kingdom of Lesotho has embarked on 
a path of Comprehensive National Reforms , 
aimed at addressing the legacy of political and 
security instability.  
 
These reforms, supported by our international 
partners —including the United Nations, the 
European Union, the Commonwealth, the 
Southern African Development Community and 
the African Union , have culminated in the 
adoption of the Tenth Amendment to our 
Constitution, a landmark achievement in our 
pursuit of sustainable peace and stability.  
 
6 
 Under my leadership, the Government of 
Lesotho remains resolute in engaging all 
stakeholders to complete the remaining 
components of this vital process.  
 
We recognize that peace and security are the 
foundations for inclusive and sustainable 
development.  
 
The success of our reform agenda will serve as 
a testament to the power of preventive 
diplomacy and its alignment with the principles 
of the United Nations Charter.  
 
In this regard, we call upon our friends and 
partners across the globe to continue supporting 
our reform efforts, so that Lesotho  can reclaim 
its rightful place among the Comity of Nations.  
 
 
Madam President,  
7 
 At the sub -regional level, the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) has 
acknowledged a significant milestone in 
Lesotho’s national reform journey by formally 
removing the Kingdom from the SADC Organ 
Troika agenda of countries under special 
observa tions.  
 
We welcome this decision with deep 
appreciation and reaffirm our unwavering 
commitment to completing the remaining 
constitutional amendments, namely the Eleventh 
and Twelfth  Amendments .  
 
With the continued support of the international 
community, we are confident that our collective 
efforts will culminate in lasting peace and 
stability while pa ving way for inclusive economic 
development.  
 
Madam President,  
8 
 The theme of this 80th Session —Better 
Together: 80 Years and More for Peace, 
Development and Human Rights —resonates 
profoundly with the founding principles of the 
United Nation s.  
 
It also reflects the enduring mission of the United 
Nations . It further calls  for renewed multilateral 
cooperation to address global challenges , and 
advance the pillars of peace, sustainable 
development, and human rights.  
 
Madam President,  
We welcome the outcomes of the Fourth 
International Conference on Financing for 
Development and the Third United Nations 
Conference on Landlocked Developing 
Countries.  
 
These landmark gatherings offered Member 
States a rare opportunity to renew their 
9 
 commitment to bridging the financing gap for 
developing nations and to address the unique 
challenges faced by countries in special 
situations, such as Lesotho.  
 
While Official Development Assistance (ODA) is 
regrettably in decline, it remains a vital source of 
development financing for Least Developed 
Countries. Its reduction threatens to erode the 
progress achieved thus far.  
 
We therefore, make  a clarion call to development 
partners to honour their ODA commitments, 
thereby safeguarding vulnerable nations from 
the risk of entrenched poverty and 
underdevelopment.  
 
At the national level, Lesotho is intensifying 
efforts to mobilize domestic resources by curbing 
illicit financial flows and enhancing revenue 
administration.  
10 
  
This includes improving the efficiency of our tax 
systems and broadening the tax base through 
aggressive industrialization .  
 
We are also embarking on a transformative path 
through the Just Energy Transition Initiative, a 
visionary programme championed by His 
Majesty King Letsie III.  
 
As we may all be aware, Lesotho is endowed 
with the  pristine mountain waters, strong  winds, 
and year -round sunshine  thus offering unique  
potential for hydro, wind, and solar energy.  
 
Our goal is to harness these resources to 
achieve our domestic and regional energy 
security and climate adaptation.  
 
This clean energy potential also creates 
opportunities for Lesotho to host data centers, 
11 
 powered sustainably by renewables and cooled 
naturally by our temperate highland climate.  
 
Such facilities would not only advance Africa’s 
digital transformation but also do so in a way that 
is environmentally responsible and cost -
effective .  
 
Lesotho is therefore , open for investments and 
partnerships in building global data centres , 
renewable energy  and water resources.   
 
 
 
Madam President,  
Digital transformation is reshaping our world. For 
developing countries like Lesotho, the 
implementation of the Global Digital Compact is 
not a luxury —it is a necessity.  
 
12 
 To ensure resilience and inclusive development, 
the Government of Lesotho is prioritizing 
investments in affordable digital infrastructure, 
promoting digital literacy, and nurturing 
innovation ecosystems.  
 
These efforts are particularly focused on 
empowering youth, women, and rural 
communities.  
 
Let us bear in mind that the continent of Africa is 
home to the largest number of youth , that is 70% 
under the age of 30 years .  
 
Our collective ability to harness their potential in 
different productive sectors  of our economies 
remains one of the most viable solutions to our 
structural challenges.  
 
In this regard, we invite all and sundry to ensure 
youth participation in governance, 
13 
 entrepreneurship, and decision -making 
processes.  
 
Madam President,  
Agriculture remains the cornerstone of economic 
activity in Landlocked Least Developed 
Countries. However, it is disproportionately 
affected by climate shocks.  
 
To mitigate these impacts, greater investment s 
in adaptation and resilience are essential.  
 
We warmly welcome the proposal to establish 
Regional Agriculture Research Hubs under the 
Awaza Programme of Action for LLDCs  to 
mitigate the impact of climate  change .  
 
Such centres have the potential to provide 
access to sustainable agricultural practices and 
innovations critical for enhancing agricultural 
security and reducing poverty.  
14 
  
I am happy to reaffirm Lesotho’s interest in 
hosting such a centre for the African Region.  
 
Madam President,  
Addressing the global climate emergency and 
ecosystem degradation demands coordinated 
international action.  
 
Extreme weather events, erratic rainfall, and 
drought threaten food systems, water resources, 
and financial stability.  
 
The preservation of biodiversity and sustainable 
management of natural resources —on land and 
at sea —are critical to climate adaptation.  
 
Though landlocked, Lesotho recognizes the 
integral role of oceans in the global climate 
system.  
 
15 
 In this spirit, Lesotho signed the Agreement on 
the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine 
Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National 
Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) on 13 June 2025, 
during the United Nations Ocean Conference in 
France.  
 
This act , reaffirms our belief that stewardship of 
the high seas is a shared responsibility of all 
humankind.  
 
 
Madam President,  
A healthy population is the bedrock of a resilient 
and prosperous nation.  
 
Lesotho remains committed to ensuring 
equitable, accessible, and quality healthcare for 
all, regardless of age, gender, or location.  
 
16 
 We continue to expand primary healthcare 
services, with emphasis on sexual and 
reproductive health, maternal and child health, 
communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis, and the growing burden of non -
communicable diseases.  
 
Lesotho also recognizes that universal health 
coverage cannot be achieved without 
addressing gender inequality.  
 
We remain steadfast in mainstreaming gender 
equality, strengthening women’s rights, and 
eliminating gender -based violence.  
 
Madam President,  
As we mark eighty (80) years of the United 
Nations, the UN institutional reforms are indeed , 
essential for relevance and efficiency.  
 
17 
 Eight decades since its founding, the United 
Nations must evolve to meet contemporary 
challenges. Reform of the UN Security Council 
must not remain a distant aspiration eternally.   
 
Deliberate efforts by all of us must be made 
towards ensuring that negoti ations garner the 
requisite support so that the historic injustices of 
the past are corrected.  
 
For us as Lesotho , we reaffirm our support for  
the common African position which is commonly 
known as the  ‘Ezulwini Consensus ’. 
 
We also welcome the Secretary -General’s UN80 
initiative aimed at enhancing the Organization’s 
effectiveness.  
 
As this initiative unfolds, we emphasize the 
importance of equitable representation within the 
18 
 Secretariat and sensitivity to the vulnerabilities of 
developing states.  
 
We trust that Member States will be duly 
consulted throughout this process.  
 
 
Madam President,  
Lesotho remains committed to the maintenance 
of international peace and security, a core 
mandate of the United Nations.  
 
Yet, we are deeply troubled by ongoing armed 
conflicts around the world, which pose grave 
threats to global stability.  
 
Of particular concern is the protracted conflict in 
Gaza, which has resulted in immense human 
suffering, especially among women, children, 
and other vulnerable groups.  
 
19 
 We commend efforts by Member States to 
pursue peace in the Middle East conflict and call 
for the immediate and unconditional release of 
all remaining hostages.  
 
We further call for a permanent ceasefire to 
prevent further loss of innocent lives. The 
resolution of international disputes must be 
grounded in dialogue, justice, and equality.  
 
Lesotho continues to advocate for a Two -State 
solution, in accordance with relevant United 
Nations resolutions.  
 
Madam President  
The use of unilateral coercive measures by 
some states on others , remain a source of 
concern for my delegation.  
 
The consequences of such measures are also 
felt beyond the borders of the targeted countries.  
20 
 Under this regime, the peoples of Zimbabwe and 
Cuba continue to suffer for unnecessarily too 
long.  
 
My delegation therefore renews its call for 
unconditional removal of the unilateral sanctions 
in order to afford these two countries the 
opportunity to achieve the most aspired 
development.  
 
As I conclude, Madam President, Lesotho 
remains steadfast in its commitment to the 
implementation of the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), recognizing them as a blueprint 
for inclusive and resilient development.  
 
Through a whole -of-government and whole -of-
society approach, Lesotho has integrated the 
SDGs into its national development frameworks 
and continues to align sectoral policies 
accordingly.  
21 
  
The country has demonstrated transparency and 
accountability by regularly submitting Voluntary 
National Reviews (VNRs) to the United Nations, 
showcasing progress, identifying challenges, 
and reaffirming its dedication to leaving no one 
behind.  The last of these reports w as presented 
in July 2025.  
 
The 80th anniversary of the United Nations 
marks a profound milestone in the collective 
journey of humanity toward peace, development, 
and the protection of human rights.  
 
Over eight decades, the Organization has stood 
as a beacon of multilateral cooperation, guiding 
Member States through moments of triumph and 
adversity.  
 
As we commemorate this legacy, we must also 
look ahead with renewed purpose and resolve. 
22 
 The future demands a United Nations that is 
more inclusive, responsive, and equipped to 
address emerging global challenges —from 
climate change and digital transformation , to 
rising inequality and geopolitical tensions.  
 
The next chapter must be defined by bold action, 
strengthened solidarity, and a shared 
commitment to leave no one behind.  
 
I thank you for your attention .
