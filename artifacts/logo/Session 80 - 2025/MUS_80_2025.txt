Statement  by The Honourable D. Ramful  
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and 
International Trade  
Republic of Mauritius  
80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
Friday 26  September 2025  
 
Your  Excellency , the President of the General Assembly  
Your  Excellency,  the Secretary -General of the United  Nations  
Excellencies  
Distinguished Delegates,  
 
Eighty years ago, in the aftermath of the atrocities and horrors of 
the deadliest  conflict  in human history , the  UN Charter was 
signed as a promise  that: 
 
• future generations will be spared from the scourge of war ; 
• States would pursue global peace ; 
• international cooperation would be the cornerstone  of our  
shared  prosperity and progress ; and  
• human rights would be protected . 
 
 
The theme – ‘Better Together - 80 years and more for peace, 
development and human rights ’ –resonates deeply with these 
 
2 2 
founding ideals  of our Organisation . There can be ‘no peace 
without development, no development without peace and neither 
peace nor development are sustainable without respect for 
human rights’.  
 
The UN has stood as a beacon of hope  by, amongst others : 
• Catalyzing decolonization;  
• Adopting  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;  
• Deploying over 70 peacekeeping operations;  
• Leading global efforts in times of pandemics;  
• Providing food aid to  million s of people;  and 
• Working in over 170 countries to help eradicate poverty, 
reduce inequalities and build resilience . 
 
These are not just facts and figures.  These are testimonies of 
what we can achieve by working  together in good faith with a 
common purpose.   These are demonstrations of how the UN is 
making a difference in people’s  lives.  
 
Unfortunately,  behind  these figures, also hide s the continued 
suffering of hundreds of millions of our fellow humans  living  in 
conflict zones, subject to violations of their human rights, and for 
whom basic human needs remain a dream.  
 
The winds of conflicts  are blowing across almost all continents .  
All marked with blatant violations of international law.   Each of 
them represents  the failure of humanity to protect its most 
vulnerable . 
 
3 3 
 
Each of them is a failure of diplomacy and  the upholding of  
international law!  
 
In addition, p rotectionism and the consequences of the COVID -
19 pandemic have put  at stake the livelihoods of millions of 
people, especially in the developing world.  
 
Madam President , 
 
Relation s between states should not  be a zero -sum game.  For 
the last 80 years, the UN has been a forum that allowed 
coordinat ion and harmoniz ation in the pursuit of common goals.  
For the continued relevance of the multilateral decision -making 
system, its legitimacy has to be restored.  It should respond to the 
needs of  all, and especially  the Global South.  
 
We welcome the holding of the various conferences this year.  
Bringing together the world community  to chart the path for future 
cooperation for our common good.  F or instance, we met in  Nice 
for the Ocean Conference  and in Sevilla for the Conference on 
Financing for Development.  Later this year , we will meet in Doha 
for the Worl d Social Summit and in Belem for COP 30.  
 
It is however unfortunate, that we missed the opportunity to 
conclude the Treaty on Plastic Pollution and protect our planet . 
 
But then what matters  is how far decisions are translated into 
concrete actions.

Madam President , 
 
The world today is facing what may be accurately described as a 
“poly -crisis”: persistent conflicts, climate emergencies, 
environmental degradation, growing inequalities, cyber 
criminality , exacerbated by artificial intelligence!  
 
This begs the question: Is the UN with its current operational 
structure equipped  to face the challenges ?  
 
We need a more efficient and effective organization.  I  welcome 
the Secretary -General ’s UN 80 Initiative .  A n opportunity to 
reimagine the future of multilateral cooperation .  A UN System 
that responds to the new and complex challenges of today while 
preparing the ground for future generations.  
 
Mauritius supports the long overdue reforms of the Security 
Council and the revitalisation of the General Assembly.  
 
 
 
Reform of the Security Council is essential for the future of the 
United Nations and global emancipation.  As our Organisation 
turns 80, the Security Council membership should reflect the 
realities of today.  It needs to be more inclusive, representative , 
and accountable.  
 
 
5 5 
Africa make s almost thirty percent (30 %) of the UN membership .  
Yet, it is un-represented in the permanent category  in the 
Security Council .  Africa has the legitimate right to have its say in 
matters of the world, with no less than two permanent seats on 
the Security Council.  
 
India has now emerged as a major global player , and should 
have a  permanent  seat o n the Council , commensurate with its 
cons tructive role in global affai rs. 
 
Mauritius supports the G4 and the L69 in their efforts to promote 
a constructive dialogue on a more representative and equitable 
composition of the Security Council.  
 
Madam President , 
 
Mauritius is fortunate to have a robust and viable democratic 
system.  
 
 
 
The new Government elected in November last, has been 
entrusted with the duty of making Mauritius better, and bringing 
the people together.   A mission that echoes well with the theme 
of this eightieth session.  
 
Mauritius will continue to place people at the centre of its national 
development, with particular focus on women, youth and 
vulnerable groups.  
 
6 6 
 
True prosperity can only be achieved when economic growth, 
social inclusion, and environmental sustainability advance 
together.   Mauritius remains committed to this path.  
 
As a Small Island Developing State  (SIDS) , faced with the 
devastating impacts of climate change, external economic shocks 
and geopolitical uncertainties, we value multilateralism.  We value 
the role of the UN in shaping a world governed by the rule of law 
and not allowing the force of anarchy to take over.  
 
Madam President , 
 
In 2015, we committed to the global ambition of ending poverty, 
protecting our planet and ensuring that all people enjoy peace 
and prosperity through the UN Agenda 2030 . 
 
We are just 5 years from our own deadline . 
 
 
 
Globally, the SDGs are far off -track .  Finance remain s the major 
challenge faced by SIDS , like Mauritius.  We need long -term 
investment in sustainable development  and strong multilateral 
cooperation.  
 
Climate change is a reality.   Mauritius is not spared from its 
cataclysmic impact.  
 
 
7 7 
Episodes of prolonged droughts, flash floods and cyclones are 
more and more frequent.  Air temperature has increased by up to 
1.39 degree Celsius.  Sea level is rising by 8 mm per year , 
compared to the global average of 3.3 mm.  
 
The socio -economic challenges posed with these irreversible 
changes are enormous for us to face alone.  Among st others, our 
tourism industry is affected, agricultural production is decreasing,  
and food security is real cause for concern.  
 
The historic Advisory Opinion  of the International Court of Justice  on 
Climate Change last July is clear and unambiguous.  We all have a 
responsibility to protect the climate system.  Obligations under the 
Paris Agreement to provide financial support, technical assistance 
and technology transfer are binding.  
 
 
 
 
 
Mauritius calls upon all Member States to translate these legal 
obligations into concrete climate action and enhanced support for 
the most vulnerable nations.   The international community should 
ensure that the assistance  that we need for adaptation, mitigation 
and building our resilience are made available.  
 
Madam President , 
 
 
8 8 
We are pleased to note the g reater recourse to the ICJ in recent 
years .  We hope that the reforms agenda will include measures to 
increase its effectiveness in peaceful settlement of disputes.  
 
Mauritius particularly applauds the Advisory Opinion  of the ICJ  on 
the Chagos Archipelago which paved the way for negotiations 
that led  to the signature of an agreement in May this year 
between  the Governments of Mauritius and  of the United 
Kingdom.  
 
This is a vindication of international law.  
 
In this context, Mauritius is strongly committed to protecting and 
preserving the pristine marine environment of the Chagos 
Archipelago. In this regard, it is in the process of establishing a 
Chagos Archipelago Marine Protected Area, whilst taking into 
account the aspiration of Mauritian citizens of Chagossian origin 
to resettle in the Chagos Archipelago.  
 
 
 
Mauritius  extends its deep appreciation for the support received 
from UN Member States right from the early 70’s up to the 
adoption of the UNGA Resolution  on 22 May 2019 in support of 
the ICJ advisory opinion.  
 
Madam President , 
 
 
9 9 
Mauritius reiterates its principled and longstanding stance in 
support of the Palestinian cause, which led to our recognition of 
the State of Palestine in November 1988.  
 
78 years after the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 181, 
the State of Palestine continues to be denied full membership of 
the United Nations.  
 
Mauritius welcomes the overwhelming support for a two -State 
solution and endorses the New York Declaration on the Peaceful 
Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation 
of the Two -State Solution.  
 
We call on the international community to spare no effort to 
achieve this solution.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Madam President , 
 
The transformative potential of AI and digital  technologies are 
undeniable ; but they also represent real challenges for 
contemporary society.   AI‘s capabilities should be harnessed 
responsibly and collectively.  
 
There is need to build a global governance architecture  through 
multilateral negotiations  that will ensure safe, secure, ethical and 
 
10 10 
inclusive use of AI.  Resource and capacity constraints of 
developing economies have to be acknowledged and addressed .  
The digital divide should  not be allowed to widen further.    
 
We welcome the recent establishment of the UN Independent 
International Scientific Panel on AI and the Global Dialogue on AI 
Governance . 
 
Madame la Présidente,  
 
Je tiens à  renouveler l’engagement de mon pays à soutenir 
pleinement la coopération régionale et la mise en commun des  
efforts des pays riverains de l'océan Indien dans l'intérêt de tous.   
C’est notre version régionale  de ‘Better Together’ . 
 
Maurice est honoré e par la présence sur son territoire des sièges 
de deux organisations des pays de l'océan Indien , notamment la 
Commission de l’Océan Indien (la COI) et l’Association des pays 
riverains de l’Océan Indien (l’IORA) . 
Nous avons conclu en 2012 un accord avec les Seychelles pour 
la cogestion d’une vaste zone maritime .  Nous travaillons pour sa 
mise en œuvre.  
 
Je tiens à rappeler qu’après la reconnaissance de notre 
souveraineté sur l’archipel des Chagos par le Royaume uni, 
Maurice s’attend au même dénouement en ce qu’il s’agit de notre 
souveraineté sur l’île de Tromelin.  
 
 
 
11 11 
To conclude, Madam President , 
 
Let me reiterate our strong conviction that we are indeed, Better 
Together.  
 
And to continue to be Better Together, we must adapt, reform 
and reinvigorate the UN.  
 
In this regard, t he Pact for the Future charts a new course for 
international cooperation.  
 
Let us rise to the challenge.   Let us be bold in our actions, 
compassionate in our leadership and united in our resolve . No 
one should be  left behind.  
 
Thank you .
