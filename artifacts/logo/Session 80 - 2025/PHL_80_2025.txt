1 80TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
 
GENERAL DEBATE  
 
NATIONAL STATEMENT  
 
to be delivered by  
 
HON. MA. THERESA P. LAZARO  
SECRETARY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS  
 
27 September 2025  
UN General Assembly Hall, UN Headquarters  
New York, NY  
 
Speaking time: 15 minutes  
 
 
Mr./Madam President (depending on who is presiding) , 
 
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
At the closing of the San Francisco Conference in 1945, Filipino General Carlos 
P. Romulo, declared the UN Charter as an achievement for all humanity . It is 
an accomplishment, he said, that “will embrace and protect, as at the same time 
that it liberates, the human spirit.”  
  
Our faith in the UN Charter endures, as the international community celebrates 
the 80th anniversary of the United Nations.  
  
United in purp ose, we the  193 member states of the United Nations are 
stewards of this edifice . It counts on our courage to be equal to the task it 
bestows on us.  
 
A COVENANT OF PEACE  
  
The United Nations was born in the rubble of war.  
 
We embarked on a peace that works not only for the powers of that day but also 
for all of humanity , for all time.    
We forged, through the Charter, a covenant of just and equitable peace.

2    
Yet today, we ponder on the triumphs of this shared journey amidst the jolting 
clamor for peace and humanity under the very circumstances for which the 
United Nations was conceived.  
  
We must end the suffering of millions who live in starvation and fear in Gaza.   
  
Ceasefires must hold. Humanitarian access must be restored without 
restrictions.  Children, women, and innocent civilians must be s aved  from further 
violence. Healing must begin.  The Two -State solution is the only viable 
diplomatic solution for sustainable peace.  
 
We must end the conflict in Ukraine.  A just peace is only possible with respect 
for Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity.  
  
We must double down to address humanitarian crises around the world,  looking 
at their roots and investing in durable solutions.  We must  protect and assist 
displaced  populations in Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo, the Sahel region, of the Rohingyas  and in many other parts of the 
world  
 
This June, the Secretary General reported over 40,000 cases of violations 
against children in armed conflict, the highest recorded in 30 years. This is 
unconscionable. We owe our children peace.  
  
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  
  
As UN founders recognized that peace was the antidote to fragility and 
uncertainty after the war, t hese  times call on the United Nations, particularly the 
Security Council, to make bold decisions. We must f orge new pathways for 
international peace and security.  
  
This is a challenge that the Philippines is ready to rise up to, as we seek a  a 
non-permanent seat in the Security Council for the term 2027 to 2028. We look 
ahead to the solemn honor of serving this body .  
  
The Philippines is committed to contribute to the Security Council in a manner 
that takes into account the views and concerns of the general UN membership 
and other principal organs of the United Nations . 
We recognize the weight of the responsibility of the Security Council. When it 
acts for the interest of humanity, it is a fulcrum of change, a force for good, and 
UNGA80 General Debate National Statement

3 a bastion of hope for populations trapped in hopeless situations.  
  
We seek to be part of it to help advance the cause of global peace, with the 
depth of experience earned from our struggles for peace.   
 
In the Philippines, we know that beyond stopping hostilities, peace is a just 
order, with individuals flourishing in dignity at its center.  
  
The success story of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao 
or BARMM tells us that peacebuilding, though sometimes arduous and long,   
endows communities their rightful future.   
 
Our vision for  global  peace finds its home in the 1982 Manila Declaration on the 
Peaceful Settlement of Disputes.  
 
“IN LARGER FREEDOM:” NEW DEMANDS OF DEVELOPMENT  
  
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  
  
The UN Charter binds nations in promoting peace and progress “in larger 
freedom.”  
  
This drives  our quest for global solutions to the transcendent challenges that 
affect nations . New models  are needed to achieve  equitable, sustainable, and 
inclusive development.  
 
For decades, the UN development system has aided transformation in many 
nations , including the Philippines.  
 
Amidst current funding shortfalls, we must support reforms to help it deliver 
value to UN Member States, in tight accord with national priorities, with less 
bureaucracy and fragmentation.  
  
It is regrettable that politics and the demands of war have cut development 
financing globally, just as we embark on the last -mile of the SDG agenda.   
  
This has shifted the focus to the roles of developing and middle -income 
countries  as shapers of development solutions.   
And why not?  Together, we are the fastest growing economies, the largest 
consumer markets, and the top sources of human capital.  
  
UNGA80 General Debate National Statement

4 Even as we manage our share of economic vulnerabilities within our borders, 
developing nations are assuming greater responsibility  as agents of 
transformative and inclusive cooperation . 
 
We are actively reshaping  the global development agenda in the 21st century.    
  
In the Financing for Development  Conference  in Sevilla, we faced the sobering 
truth that the current financial system is untenable.  It is one that has foste red 
debt burdens and perpetuated power imbalance – a system that mires the poor 
and favors the wealthy.  
  
Structural asymmetries undermine the ability of developing countries, 
particularly climate -vulnerable ones, to mobilize the scale and quality of finance 
required for resilient development.  
  
Access to finance remains skewed. Climate -vulnerable d eveloping countries 
face borrowing costs that exceed their projected growth rates . 
  
The eligibility crite ria for concessional finance is  tied to outdated income 
classifications , with no account  for risks and  vulnerabilities faced by  many 
countries that need such lifelines  for sustaining their growth.  
  
Reforms are long overdue.  
  
Multilateral processes must confront the widening gap between climate 
ambition and the means of implementation, whether in terms of financial 
resources, technology transfer or capacity building.  
  
Developed countries must fulfill their financial obligations. Multilateral 
development banks must do their part.  
 
Climate finance is a binding commitment, as affirmed by the International Court 
of Justice in its unanimous Advisory Opinion last July .  
   
We need to rebalance decision -making power in global financing institutions. 
Developing countries  must be  co-architects of systems that determine 
allocation, eligibility, and accountability.  
Excellencies, distinguished delegates  
  
As a maritime country known for its mega -biodiversity, the Philippines considers 
the sustainability of our environmental ecosystem as key to our climate and 
UNGA80 General Debate National Statement  
DFA-UNIO draft as of 27 September 2025, 0725H  
 
5 economic resilience.   
 
I am pleased to announce the Philippines’ ratification of the  BBNJ Agreement.  
This is in line with our commitment to  the rules -based international order and 
the 1982 UNCLOS . We are determined to  advanc e the just governance of the 
oceans and the conservation of marine biodiversity.  
  
In our reflection on evolving  multilatera lism to be more fit-for-purpose , we must 
consider progress in the way we account for our stewardship of resources.  Our 
economic models must account for the health of our planet.  
 
We must measure our success in promoting development “in larger freedom” in 
our accountability to every  nation and  every person of the community.  Societies 
thrive in diversity and inclusion.  
 
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  
  
We stand in the midst of a global revolution – of people, of economies, and of 
technologies.   
 
Migration straddles these changes.  The movement of people across borders 
sustains growth in countries of origin, transit, and destination alike.  
 
Every day, Filipino migrants across the world are a testament to this. They 
support health systems, advance education and boost creative economies.    
 
The 1 .9 million seafarers  are the backbone of maritime trade that accounts for 
90% of global commerce. The International Conference on Seafarers' Human 
Rights, Safety, and Well -being  held in Manila  early this month  affirmed that 
states and stakeholders are ready to do more for them.  
 
As migrants link our nations, their rights and dignity should be a gathering point , 
not a faultline,  for governmen ts. 
  
Technology is the other defining force of our age: a connector, an enabler, an 
equalizer.  
Artificial Intelligence offers promise but carries profound risks.  We must help 
build digital societies that bridges  development  divides  rather than widen them, 
conforming with  safeguards against misuse.  
 
STEADY HANDS  
UNGA80 General Debate National Statement  
DFA-UNIO draft as of 27 September 2025, 0725H

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  
  
Over the last 80 years, the UN Charter has served as a wellspring of purpose 
and action for those who rise equal to the task of delivering its promise.   
  
There is no alternative to the United N ations.  There is no good  global order 
other than one based on international law and the principle of the sovereign 
equality of states.  
  
A rules -based order is indispensable.  
  
To maritime nations such as the Philippines, international law, particularly the 
1982 Law of the Sea, is fundamental to our future.  
 
While our government vessels and fisherfolk continue to be harassed in our 
own waters, and as we remain on the receiving end of illegal, coercive, 
aggressive, and dangerous actions in the South China Sea1, we abide by the 
UNCLOS as reinforced by the binding 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China 
Sea.  
 
We are  committed to diplomacy and other peaceful means to settle disputes.  
  
At the birth of the UN, the Philippines actively helped in framing the foundational 
principle  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which states that “ all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. ”   
  
The early decades of the UN saw the spirited engagement of Filipino diplomats 
against colonization and apartheid2 and economic inequality.  
 
We have steadfastly strived for justice.  
 
For its cause, we have helped manned  the frontlines of climate diplomac y – 
from the drafting of the Climate Change Convention itself, to the Kyoto Protocol, 
and the Paris Agreement.  
  
We have engage d with the fire of a nation familiar with the brunt of devastation 
of disasters and extreme weather events. We know the urgency of global action.

Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.

Justice  and equity  was our g uidepost during the crafting  of the WHO Pandemic 
Agreement . The adoption of this treaty last May was a sweet spot in the 
Philippines’ Presidency of the World Health Assembly.  
 
Our pledge to peace is unwavering.  
  
The Philippines w as among the first  to respond to the UN call for assistance in 
the Korean War.  A decade later, Philippine troops flew halfway across the globe 
to aid in peacekeeping operations in the Congo.  Since then,  we have sent 
nearly 15,000 troops to 21 peacekeeping missions in Africa, Middle East, and 
Asia-Pacific.  
  
This experience has taught us that peacekeeping is about empowering 
communities. It must carve exit strategies , with focused, non -politicized 
mandates from the Security Council. New models must be tailored to context 
and needs on the ground.  
 
Then as now, we embrace our role as a bridge -builder: as General Carlos P. 
Romulo put it in 1946, a “ bridge between two worlds , among the first of many 
that must be erected to make them one. ”3 
 
Then as now, we offer steady hands in New York, Genev a, Vienna, Bangkok, 
Nairobi, Rome, and the cradles of joint action as a ‘partner, pathfinder, and 
peacemaker.’  
 
RISING TO THE CALL OF THE UN AT 80  
  
Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  
  
Our world is far different from the world inhabited by the founders of the UN. 
Our new realities test the durability of the Charter at its eightieth year.  
The measure of credibility  for the UN is wh ether it can hold its  ‘sovereign 
promise’ in today’s world, where nations shape the future on equal terms.  
 
As I conclude, I recall General Romulo’s words at the First UN General 
Assembly in 1946 that the Filipin o stake in the United Nations is  one of “an 
identical destiny, of shared anxiety, of hope and endeavor.”

8 The journey of the  entire  family of the United Nations has been one of hope and 
endeavor.  
 
In the strength of our diversity, the UN is the common vessel steering humanity 
through the onslaught of challenge and change.  
 
We count on each other for the courage to hope, and courage to act .  Let us 
persevere in purpose and action as a United Nations , so we can claim before 
those who came before us and those coming after, that we have risen to the 
challenges of our time, and have far exceeded our calling.  
 
Thank you and Mabuhay .
