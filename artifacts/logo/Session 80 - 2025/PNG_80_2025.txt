Madam President, Secretary -General, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies 
and Gentlemen , 
  
First, I thank our Almighty Creator God — the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — for their care 
over my country, Papua New Guinea.  
  
It is with deep honour that I bring to this Assembly the warm greetings of ten million people. 
This year, Papua New Guinea celebrates 50 years of independence and 50 years of 
membership in the United Nations. Since joining in October 1975, we have stood pr oudly by 
the principles of the UN Charter.  
  
 Our Constitution, Our Unity  
  
At independence, our Founding Fathers gave us a single Constitution that has endured for 
half a century. It protects human rights, affirms our Christian heritage while guaranteeing 
freedom of religion, preserves culture, and safeguards our environment.  
  
Papua New Guinea is extraordinarily diverse — over 1,000 tribes, 850 languages, and 600 
islands. Yet our Constitution binds us as one people, one nation, one country.  
  
We also honour the churches who, alongside the State, deliver education, health, and 
community services that hold our nation together. Our Constitution protects all faiths, 
sending a message that religion must never divide humanity — coexistence must.  
  
Lessons of Peace  
 
Papua New Guinea has known conflict. For a decade, Bougainville suffered violence, but 
through dialogue under UN oversight we achieved the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement. 
Not a bullet has been fired since. We continue to resolve questions of Bougainvill e’s future 
through dialogue and constitutional process.  
  
Bougainville is a reminder that peace, when built on genuine will, can endure.

  Reflections on the Secretary -General’s Visit  
  
We were honoured this year to welcome Secretary -General António Guterres on his first visit 
to Papua New Guinea. He praised our leadership on climate, our diversity, and 
Bougainville’s peace model.  
  
But he also reminded us to fight corruption, strengthen governance, and ensure services 
reach all citizens. At 50 years, we recommit to transformation so that no citizen is left 
behind. His visit was both affirmation and accountability.  
   
Our Global Responsibility: Forests, Oceans, Climate  
  
Papua New Guinea is a forest nation and an ocean nation.  
                •             Our tropical forests absorb carbon and produce oxygen.  
                •             Our vast Pacific waters are part of the world’s greatest carbon sink.  
                •             Our reefs, rivers, and ecosystems shelter unique biodiversity.  
  
There is no other planet like Earth. Our ancestors left us a liveable planet; we must do the 
same for our descendants.  
  
As we approach COP30 in Brazil, we recommit to preserving forests and oceans, investing 
in renewable energy, and advancing sustainable development. But we cannot do this alone.  
  
We call especially on G20 and industrial nations to cut emissions, reform global finance to 
support biodiversity nations, and align responsibility with carbon footprint. Our forests and 
oceans are not just P apua New Guinea’s — they are global goods.  
   
Gratitude and Appeal  
  
On this 50th Anniversary, I thank:  
                •             The United Nations for embracing us since 1975,  
                •             Our bilateral and multilateral partners,  
                •             Australia for peacefully granting independence,  
                •             Investors, NGOs, and churches for their enduring service.  
  
Your solidarity has kept us united.

  Closing  
  
Fifty years ago, we entered this Assembly as one of its youngest members. Today, we stand 
as a free and democratic nation, with unity in diversity, resilience, and vast natural 
endowments.  
   
On behalf of P apua New Guinea , I congratulate  the United Nations for tuning 80 years and 
remains as humanity’s common meeting ground. Just as Papua New Guinea finds unity in 
its diversity, so must all nations uphold the UN’s sanctity.  
  
Our message to the world is simple:  
                •             Unity can be found in diversity.  
                •             Peace is built and sustained through dialogue.  
                •             This one planet must be preserved for all generations.  
  
On behalf of Papua New Guinea, I thank you.
