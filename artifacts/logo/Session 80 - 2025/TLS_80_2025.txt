Your Excellency Annalena Baerbock,  President of the General Assembly,  
On behalf of the Government and people of Timor -Leste, I extend warm 
congratulations to Your Excellency on your well -deserved election as President  
of the eightieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is an 
important step in correcting the historical gender unbalance in the leadership 
of this organization. We also thank your predecessor, Philémon Yang, for the 
way in which he conducted our work in the previous session  
We also pay tribute to the Secretary -General of the United Nations, António 
Guterres, for his steadfast leadership in these turbulent times and, above all, 
for his clear and unique voice in defence of peace.  
 
Excellencies,  
It is a great honour to address this Assembly on behalf of Timor -Leste. Our 
relationship with the United Nations is historic and decisive. For our country, 
which joined the United Nations family in 2002 following a long struggle for self -
determination, the  eightieth anniversary of the Organization is a moment for 
reflection on the transformative power of multilateralism.  
Though still young and facing the challenges that followed its difficult history, 
Timor-Leste today stands as a vibrant democratic State, an indisputable  
symbol of the triumph of the international system.  
Through the United Nations, we restored our right to independence and laid the 
foundations for the building of State institutions. Today, this family of nations 
continues to support us in our sovereign process of development and growth.  
It is also with the United Nations that we will continue, in the international 
sphere, to pursue the paths of peace, freedom, equality among peoples, and 
the right to self -determination, in every corner of the world, without exception.  
At a time when the world seems to be willingly walking towards self -
destruction , marked by international and civil conflicts, humanitarian 
emergencies, the climate catastrophe , and the resulting deepening of 
inequalities , Timor-Leste reaffirms our firm conviction that the multilateral 
system is not a choice, but a necessity.  
The United Nations emerged 80 years ago as a response to the dangers of 
isolationism and unilateral interventionism, grounded in the principles of 
dialogue and the search for collective solutions as instruments for peace, 
security, and the defence of human rights. The spirit of peace and unity that 
built this House must be renewed and strengthened in the face of the 
thousands of victims of today’s violence.  
We all must uphold  international law. For small countries like mine, it is the only 
guarantee of justice, sovereignty,  and national independence. It was 
international law that enabled us to secure sovereignty over our resources 
following the conciliation process with Australia. It is this system that allowed 
us to request an advisory opinion from the International Court o f Justice on the 
obligations of States in relation to climate change. Th is historic opinion 
determined that the right to a clean, healthy , and sustainable environment is 
inherent to the enjoyment of human rights.  
The United Nations continues to play a central role in protecting peoples, 
responding to humanitarian crises and mediating conflicts. Rejecting the 
isolation of States and unilateralism, Timor -Leste calls for this 80th General 
Assembly to be a turning poin t in relation to current conflicts.  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Deeply concerned by the erosion of international humanitarian law and the 
suffering of civilians in ongoing conflicts, Timor -Leste calls on all States to 
renew their commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, to respect 
international law , and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in conflict 
prevention.  
Peace and security remain the cornerstone of the Charter of the United 
Nations. We believe, however, that the UN cannot and must not delay in 
implementing the urgent reforms that we have all called for , first and foremost, 
to ensure its effectiveness in defending and guaranteeing human rights and 
international law, which are being violated before our very eyes in many parts 
of the world.  
The urgency of UN reform lies in addressing the structural impediments that 
prevent it from fulfilling its most basic mission  – to protect lives.  
To strengthen the global architecture for peace, Timor -Leste proposes that the 
General Assembly be given greater power and authority in security matters, to 
prevent a single Member State from paralysing the entire collective security 
system of the United Nations.  
We also underline the importance of reforming the Security Council so that it 
reflects the vitality and reality of the twenty -first century and gives voice to 
developing and smaller States. We remain firmly convinced that an expansion 
of both permanent and  non-permanent membership is necessary to reflect 
contemporary geopolitical realities. It is the right and duty of our nations to 
aspire to a Security Council that is more accountable, representative, 
transparent, relevant and, above all, effective.  
Excellencies,  
Our commitment to peace is reflected in the way we relate to the world. 
Through political -diplomatic coordination and multilateral cooperation within 
the Community of Portuguese -speaking Countries, Timor -Leste joins the 
collective effort to promote harmony , solidarity and inclusion, contributing to 
global and regional challenges.  
As a member of the g7+, Timor -Leste has brought its own experience of post -
conflict stability to influence the global agenda for peace and sustainable 
development, inspiring coordinated action and diplomacy based on sharing 
and exchange, with the aim of tr ansforming fragility into resilience. At the 6th 
Ministerial Meeting of the g7+, held in April 2025 in Dili, Timor -Leste and fellow 
conflict-affected countries renewed their commitment to peacebuilding, 
resilience and sustainable development.  
 
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and fulfilling the 2030 
Agenda must be a priority for all. We are, however, concerned that many of the 
targets to which we have committed ourselves remain far from being achieved.  
Timor-Leste formally acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2024, and 
after a committed path towards fulfilling all eligibility criteria, will, on 26 
October, become a full member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  
– another milestone in our nation -building journey. This is a moment of great 
significance for national economic development, regional integration and 
international recognition, and one of which we are very proud.  
Timor-Leste has aligned the SDGs with its Strategic Development Plan 2011 -
2030 and has made notable progress through effective and targeted public 
policies. With the current Government, we are also initiating the energy 
transition towards renewable energy production and establishing a 
consolidated policy on the blue economy.  
Having ratified the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction 
(BBNJ) in September 2024, Timor -Leste adopted in June of this year the national 
strategic framework of the Blue Economy Policy and Action Plan 2025 -2030, 
focused on the sustainable development of marine resources, improving the 
livelihoods of coastal communities and protecting ecosystems.  
Nonetheless, the achievement of the SDGs does not depend solely on the 
individual will of each nation. It requires concerted and collaborative global 
commitment, shared values of humanity, the fight against inequality, peaceful 
coexistence and the protecti on of our only home, Planet Earth.  
We must not forget the enormous inequalities that persist in the world. For 
developed countries, achieving the SDGs may be a simple political choice, 
allocating resources in their budgets. For many others, their realization 
depends on development assistance, solidarit y and international cooperation 
in terms of financial resources and the transfer of knowledge.  
Timor-Leste, as part of the g7+, the group of least developed countries and of 
small island developing States, is especially vulnerable to the many factors that 
threaten the achievement of the SDGs.  
It is necessary to recognize these special circumstances of small island 
developing States (SIDS)  - a foundational principle of development since 1992, 
reflected in the Seville Commitment and the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for 
SIDS. The unique vulnerabilities of SIDS, with their small size, remote location 
and limited resources, require tailored and diff erentiated development 
approaches. It is particularly urgent to translate  commitments into predictable 
and increased means of implementation.  
Another relevant aspect in this context is the use of the Multidimensional 
Vulnerability Index (MVI) and ensuring SIDS have a seat at every table. It is no 
longer acceptable to hold discussions and make decisions on the issues that 
most affect us without o ur participation. The international financial 
architecture must be reformed so that the MVI is applied in development 
support policies, access to concessional financing and technical assistance.  
Climate change is undermining already fragile food security, striking our 
countries with natural disasters that divert vital resources to reconstruction 
and humanitarian relief. For this reason, it is particularly important  - especially 
for industrialized countries and major polluters  - that commitments under the 
Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact be honoured, with the 
allocation of resources for true climate justice. The opportunity to achieve this 
objective is before us at COP30 in Belém this No vember. It is our opportunity to 
channel ambition in the right direction, honouring the Seville Commitment.  
It is also imperative to advance AI and digital capabilities in LDCs, while 
concurrently safeguarding cybersecurity. This requires investing in digital 
infrastructure, enhancing digital literacy and implementing e -government 
initiatives. Promoting AI research and inn ovation, cultivating talent, and 
establishing a policy framework are also pivotal for fostering growth. 
Nonetheless, international cooperation remains essential to establish 
comprehensive regulations governing the use and development of AI.  
Excellencies,  
This past May, Timor -Leste hosted the Regional Conference of the United 
Nations Special Committee on Decolonization. This meeting had profound 
significance for the Committee and for all who value self -determination, 
democracy and human dignity. Holding thi s conference for the first time on 
Timorese soil allowed participants to witness our example as a success story 
and to renew collective hope for freedom and solidarity, reaffirming the crucial 
role of the United Nations in defending peoples.  
That same week, in Dili, we hosted the first Asia -Pacific Solidarity Conference 
for Western Sahara. The voice of the Sahrawi people, silenced for half a century 
on the international stage, needs and deserves our attention and our collective, 
strategic acti on. Timor -Leste’s connection with the history of Western Sahara 
is of a moral nature. In the words of our Prime Minister, Kay Rala Xanana 
Gusmão, the suffering of the Sahrawi people was a lesson for Timor -Leste when 
we decided our own popular consultation,  since the postponement, in 1992, of 
the referendum promised to Western Sahara marked all those who dreamed of 
independence.  
As the suffering of the Timorese people came to an end before that of our 
brothers and sisters, we will always, in this House and in every forum of 
dialogue, be amplifiers of the right to self -determination of Western Sahara, 
calling for a collective resol ution of the conflict.  
Drawing on its own experience of occupation and prolonged suffering, Timor -
Leste continues to advocate for dialogue, mediation and multilateral 
engagement in the pursuit of peaceful, lasting and sustainable solutions as the 
path to peace.  
Timor-Leste therefore welcomes the overwhelming adoption on 12 September 
of the New York Declaration on the peaceful settlement of the question of the 
Middle East and the implementation of the two -State solution.  
Timor-Leste recognized the State of Palestine in 2004, two years after its own 
independence. We did not, however, imagine we would witness the conflict 
escalating to the tragic proportions we see today.  
It is urgent to implement the roadmap set out in the adopted Declaration, in 
particular: an immediate ceasefire in Gaza; the release of all hostages; the 
establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State with the support and 
collaboration of the international  community; as well as the disarmament of 
Hamas and the normalization of relations between Israel and neighbouring 
Arab States, in order to guarantee collective security in the region.  
Even more urgent is the response to the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. 
After the situation of famine and genocide in the region was officially declared, 
we must waste no more time on terminology, despite the clarity of the reports. 
The world demands the immediate unblocking of large -scale humanitarian 
operations and the guarantee of security and respect for human dignity in the 
delivery of international assistance.  
We are, however, deeply concerned by the intensification of Israel’s military 
offensive in Gaza in the wake of peace efforts made here in New York in recent 
weeks. Faced with the humanitarian catastrophe, where famine already exists, 
the consequences will be devastating and irreversible for the civilian 
population.  
We reiterate the urgent need to reform this Organization and its Security 
Council, which continue to prevent us from upholding the founding principles 
of the United Nations and from saving Gaza.  
 
Excellencies,  
In Ukraine, we also witness the devastating consequences of unilateralism and 
the disregard for international law. The cost will be borne by all of us. Timor -
Leste expresses its deep concern over the grave human rights violations and 
the humanitarian  and environmental  consequences of the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine, including ongoing attacks against essential 
infrastructure, which have caused devastating impacts on the civilian 
population, including women and children. We call on all parties to the conflict 
to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, to spare 
civilians and civilian ob jects, to ensure the safety of all in accessing 
humanitarian relief, and to refrain from attacking and destroying items 
indispensable to civilian survival.  
We cannot ignore the many other theatres of violence and instability that weigh 
heavily on our common conscience - from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa, from 
the Great Lakes region to Haiti and Southeast Asia, right on our doorstep . Each 
of these crises carries its own history and complexity. Yet, they share a tragic 
pattern: the suffering of civilians, the erosion of trust in institutions, and the 
perpetuation of cycles of displacement and loss. Our collective responsibility 
is to ensure that none of these  situations are consigned to silence or neglect. 
They demand not only humanitarian relief and respect for international law, but 
also the sustained investment of this Organization in prevention, dialogue and 
inclusive political solutions that restore hope and dignity to those who endure 
them.  
 
There can be no justice without accountability. At a time when violations of 
international law, including international humanitarian law, and acts of 
aggression are on the rise, it is urgent that we all promote and defend our 
institutions and their work. W e are deeply concerned by the imposition of 
sanctions on judges and other elected officials of the International Criminal 
Court, and we call for their immediate lifting.  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Timor-Leste strongly supports the lifting of the economic, commercial and 
financial embargo against the Republic of Cuba, which we consider a violation 
of human rights that harms the Cuban people and limits their access to 
essential goods. Cuba is one of T imor-Leste’s strongest partners in the health 
sector, having trained more than one thousand professionals and provided 
direct assistance to our patients in hospitals. With its active role in 
development assistance and in promoting peace, we consider Cuba’s 
inclusion on the list of State sponsors of terroris m entirely unjustified and 
therefore call for its immediate removal from the list.  
In the same spirit, we are also concerned by the imposition of unilateral 
coercive measures, such as those currently applied to Venezuela. These 
sanctions impose suffering on the Venezuelan people, hinder the 
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainab le Development, and leave 
many behind. We call for dialogue and negotiation between the parties to 
alleviate the misery that afflicts the Venezuelan people.  
 
Excellencies, to conclude:  
This 80th session of the General Assembly reminds us that the United Nations, 
though imperfect, remains our greatest common instrument for peace and 
collective progress. The values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  - 
the sovereignty of States, respect for human rights, the peaceful settlement of 
disputes and cooperation for development  - remain the compass that guides 
us. 
Let us therefore renew our commitment to multilateralism  – not as an abstract 
principle, but as a daily practice of listening, compromise and joint action. 
Timor-Leste, through its hard -won independence, stands as proof that when 
the international community acts with unity and determination, even the 
smallest and most fragile States can take their rightful place in the family of 
nations.  
As demonstrated by the race to ratify the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond 
National Jurisdiction, which will enter into force on 17 January 2026, it is in 
multilateralism, in respect for international law, and in inclusive dialogue 
among all of us that hop e resides  - for a better world for generations to come.  
Thank you very much.
