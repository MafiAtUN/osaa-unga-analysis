Madam  President , 
Mr. Secretary -General , 
Excellencies , 
Heads of State and Governments , 
Distinguished Delegates , 
Ladies and Gentlemen , 
 
It is a great  honour for me to deliver this address on behalf of the Government and people of the 
Republic of Vanuatu.  
Madam  President,   
At the outset, let me sincerely congratulate you on your well -deserved election as President of the 
80th Session of this August Assembly.  I assure you of the Vanuatu’s delegation full support and 
cooperation during your tenure.  
 
I commend your predecessor, H.E. Mr. Philemon Yang  for the great  achievements of the General 
Assembly under his leadership during these challenging times.

I would also like to extend my sincere  congratulat ion to  the Secretary -General, Mr. Antonio 
Guterres for his continued vision , wisdom and skilful leadership of the United Nations during these 
tumultuous  times.   
Global Context    
Madam President,  
Since the set-up of the United Nations  80 years ago, we have seen that the world  continues to  face 
a myriad of  complex challenges —there are ongoing  wars and violent conflicts, increased 
humanitarian emergencies, international laws are not respected, human rights violations increased, 
and poverty continues to remain . The current liquidity crisis facing the United Nations System 
limits the ability of the UN to address these challenges . 
As we celebrate the 80th Anniversary of the United Nations Charter, let us take stock of what this 
founding document really means for us. The Charter is not merely a piece of history . It is a living 
document  that binds us together in the pursuit of peace, human dignity , and shared prosperity. It 
is the expression of a collective promise: that disputes should be resolved by dialogue, not by war; 
that human rights and dignity are universal; and that nations, large and small, are equal in 
sovereignty.   
Madam  President, your theme: Better together: 80 years, more for peace, development and 
human rights is crucial at  this time . The lesson of the last  80 years is clear: no nation can meet 
these challenges alone. Multilateralism is not a choice —it is a necessity. “Better together”  is not 
only a theme but a  guiding principle  that we must work together to create a just, fair and prosperous 
world . 
Vanuatu Situation  
Madam  President,  
The Prime Minister of Vanuatu , in his  45th Independence commemoration speech on the 30th of    
July this year, called on our people to renew unity, national harmony and long -term vision —to 
hold fast to the values of faith, culture, and shared purpose, especially in times of challenge.  That 
same spirit must guide our engagement in New York today - small island states like ours cannot 
3 
 face climate change, global insecurity, or technological disruption s alone. Our independence 
reminds us that sovereignty is precious —but so too is solidarity.  
In the past few years, we have experienced  a number of  category 4-5 cyclones which  have 
contributed to the erosion of  around 30 to 60% of our economy. Moreover , in early December  17, 
2024, we  experienced a devastating earthquake in our Capital that damaged  our infrastructure  and 
buildings. The cumulative effect of these disasters is huge .  
Each disaster  erodes our infrastructure, displaces communities, and sets back economic and social 
progress. Recovery is slow  and our  resilience is tested. The compounding nature of these crises 
makes adaptation and preparedness ever more urgent —and yet, as a small island developing state, 
Vanuatu faces limitations in resources, capacity, and access to finance.   
Apart from these disasters, foreign investments in our country have been flat and this is due to a 
combination of factors , one of which is the unjust blacklisting imposed by some of our 
development partners and the difficulty of accessing funds due to the worsening of correspondent 
banking relationships. While these measures are often justified as steps toward de -risking, the 
consequences for countries like Vanuatu are severe. We call on the international community, 
financial institutions, and regulators to work with countries  that are affected by these measures and 
to recognize the unintended consequences of de -risking on small economies. Solutions must 
include enhanced dialogue, technical assistance, and proportionate risk -based approaches that 
allow bona fide  businesses and citizens to continue to participate in global commerce.  
Despite these challenges, w e are starting to see some green sh oots in our economy. O ur economy 
is anticipated  to recover  this year and in the medium -term. Of course, our growth prospects among 
other things will depe nd on a favorable external and domestic economic  environment, and  how far 
we can withstand natural disasters  in the future.  
Our development experience  thus far reveals  that as a vulnerable country which has graduated 
from  least developing country’s  status , it is not easy to chart your own course for development. 
The international environment has been unfavorable  for Small Island Developing States and 
accessing climate and development finance continues  to be challenging . The securitization of 
development finance  makes it difficult to address our most pressing development challenges .  
4 
 Just like any other small island developing states (SIDS), Vanuatu relies on the current global legal 
order that is underpinned by the UN Charter to thrive. As a nation, we will continue to espouse for 
the preservation of these ideals. Furthermore, we call  for the UN to urgently look deeper into the 
challenges of SIDS like Vanuatu and find innovative ways to assist them.  
Vanuatu in the region  
Madam President,  
This year, t he Pacific Leaders establish ed the Pacific Resilience Facility  (PRF) which aims to 
support climate project s that would  build resilience in our economies and communities in the 
Pacific. This is one of the first regional -led initiatives of its kind  in the world . I join our Pacific 
Leaders to thank our development partners that have contributed to this initiative . I call on our 
good friends and partners to contribute to this facility .  
Vanuatu at the Global Stage  
Madam President,  
As you  are well aware,  Vanuatu , with the support of a coalition of nations,  led a UN resolution 
which was adopted by the  UN General Assembly in March 2023 calling for the International Court 
of Justice (ICJ) to provide an advisory opinion on climate change.  
The Court delivered its historic opinion in July 2025 , affirming that States have clear legal 
obligations to protect the environment and human rights from the impacts of this crisis.  
For vulnerable nations, including Small Island Developing States, this opinion is a powerful 
affirmation of our long -standing call: that climate change is an existential threat , and the world has 
a legal duty to respond.  
Now that advisory opinion is rendered, Vanuatu will take a follow up  resolution  this year to the 
UN General Assembly to affirm the finding s of the Court and propose actions for the opinion to 
be operationalized.  I call upon all the UN member states to support this crucial resolution.  
Taking climate change to the ICJ via the General Assembly, is not a silver bullet for increasing 
climate action, but only one tool to get us closer to the end goal of a safe planet for humanity. That 
5 
 is why, beyond the ICJ, we are also supporting other tools to battle the existential threat of climate 
change.  
We call on all States to join the group of nations proposing to include Ecocide as the fifth 
independent crime of the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court, and thank the nations 
of Fiji, Samoa and the Democratic Republic of Congo for their exist ing support in this regard.  
Vanuatu maintains that better prevention of future environmental destruction is as fundamentally 
important as mitigating and adapting to existing damage.  We believe that criminalisation of the 
severest forms of environmental destruction at the internation al level can and should  play a 
crucial role not only in deterring harm but also in protecting rights for present and future 
generations.  
Human Rights and decolonization  
Madam President , 
The imposition of coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions, against developing 
countries is unfair and unjust. It undermines the social and economic development of these 
countries.  Such measures are in violation with the principles enshr ined in the Charter of the United 
Nations.  In this respect, we call for the uplift of the economic embargo on the Republic of Cuba.   
While the United Nations Charter establishes human rights as a fundamental pillar of the 
Organization, human rights challenges continue to persist globally. In the Pacific region, the 
human rights of indigenous peoples are yet to be adequately addressed an d remain a matter of 
ongoing concern. We acknowledge that in the recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' Communiqué, 
member states have agreed to a roadmap to address human rights concerns in the region.  
The decolonization process within the United Nations framework requires enhanced momentum, 
and it is imperative that sustained dialogue be maintained among all stakeholders. In this regard, 
Vanuatu notes the ongoing dialogue conducted between the indigenous leaders of New Caledonia 
and the Government of France in Paris this year. This dialogue has resulted in a road map, and we 
hope that this is a start for parties concerned to work collaboratively in finding the best  way 
forward toward a peaceful and progr essive future for the people of New Caledonia, in accordance 
with the principles of self -determination established in the UN Charter.

 Conclusion  
Madam  President,  
Eighty years on, the Charter calls us to action  to safeguard international peace and security, to 
strengthen multilateral cooperation, and to ensure that the United Nations continues to serve as a 
beacon of hope for present and future generations.  
By returning to the spirit of the Charter  - equality of nations, respect for rights, and shared 
responsibilit ies we can meet today’s challenges and build a future where no state, large or small, 
is left behind.  
 
Thank you.
